one- to three-player game where you are one of the \nBig Three: Churchill (UK), Roosevelt (USA), or Stalin (USSR). The object of the game is to manipulate the end of World War II to your nation\u2019s relative advantage. But this is not a game of head-to-head competition. Churchill  is a game of \u2018coopetition\u2019 \nwhere you both cooperate and compete with your opponents. This is not a wargame per se, but a political struggle amongst allies shaping the post-war world. If you are too aggressive, you can shatter the alliance creating a more dangerous post-war world.

Each of \nthe three scenarios (training, tournament, and campaign) consists of a number of conferences (three, five, and ten respectively), with all scenarios ending after the tenth conference or when the Axis surrenders. During a conference you represent one of the Big Three (Churchill, Roosevelt, or Stalin) and your staff (seven staff cards each, per conference) where you nominate, advance , and debate  issues. After the last staff card has been \nplayed, players determine who won the conference and then implement each conference issue , changing the political and \nmilitary situation on the board. The conference concludes with the Allied military forces, called Fronts, attempting to advance \nalong their Front Track toward Germany and Japan. When both \nGermany and Japan have surrendered, the war is over, and the \nplayers conduct a final tally of Victory Points (VPs) to determine the winner of the game.\n3.2 Map\nThe map is divided into two separate displays: the conference display and the military display. \n3.21 The conference display is where most of the player inter -\nactions occur and represents a circular conference table. The \nmiddle of this display is the \u2018center of the table\u2019 or the \u2018zero space\u2019. Radiating from the center of the table are national tracks, one associated with each player and connected to their Leader\u2019s chair, with spaces numbered one to six.\nIssues will begin in the center of the table and move toward your \nor your allies\u2019 chairs. At the end of the conference you win all issues on your side of the table or in your chair.

Each player should use two of their Clandestine Network markers to denote their score in terms of x10 and x1 points. For example the score of 21 would be shown with a marker in the 2 space of the x10 \ntrack and in the 1 space of the x1 track.\n3.22 The military display is divided into European and Pacific Theaters. At the center of the European Theater is Germany and in the Pacific Theater is Japan. Germany and Japan are col-lectively known as the Axis powers. A number of Front Tracks, divided into spaces, spiral in towards the Axis powers. The final space on each track (except the Mediterranean Front) is one of the Axis powers.\nEach Front Track has one specific Allied (US, UK, USSR) Front \nmarker associated with it.

In some cases these differ from modern spellings.\n3.25 The military map has an Arctic Front. This Front does not have a track for military offensives, but naval support markers can be deployed there. The Arctic Front contains spaces for Norway and Finland where Clandestine Network and Political Alignment markers may be placed if the appropriate conditions have been met.\n3.26 The military map has two circular locations where markers \nare placed to show whether the US or the UK has control over the Theaters\u2019 leadership.\n3.27 Counter Descriptions\nThe Offensive support markers have a \nx1 and a x 2 side.

There are no rules per se on how to use \nthem, but we have found that flipping over a Production marker once it is committed is helpful.

Leader cards are covered in section 3.31 and Staff cards are covered in section 3.33. A Conference card is revealed at the beginning of every Conference. Each Conference card has colored bands denoting which player or game situation they impact. \n Green: Churchill\n Red: Stalin\n Blue: Roosevelt\n Gray: Military situation\n White: Clandestine Network and Political Alignment\nEach instruction describes what must be done. Due to the large amount of information and the limitations on card size some shorthand is used.\n1. When a card refers to an Offensive or naval marker, this \nmeans place an Offensive support or naval support marker respectively. \n2. When a card refers to production it means the commitment of a production marker/counter during the production segment.\n3. Cards often state that an issue is placed on the Conference table, pick the issue and place it on the center of the conference table. Issues are specified by the title of the issue such as when a card states place a Directed Offensive, it refers to a Directed Offensive issue counter.\n3.3 Personalities and Issues Overview\n3.31 Leaders\nIn the game you are one of the three Allied Leaders and their nation.

Alternatively, Leaders can be used to win ties during the conference; see tiebreaker procedure (4.5).\n3.32 National Characteristic\nEach player benefits from a different advantage called a national \ncharacteristic. \nChurchill/UK (Imperial Staff): During the Agenda Segment \neach British staff card has its printed value modified by adding one. \nRoosevelt/US (Arsenal of Democracy): In any tiebreak situa-\ntion not broken by a Leader card, the US wins the tie if they are directly involved; if not involved, they determine which of the other two players wins the tiebreak.\nUSSR (Nyet): Any Soviet staff card (note that Stalin is not a \nstaff card) used in debate has one added to its value, in addition \nto its other attributes.\nA player may never avoid using a national characteristic bonus \nif it is applicable.\n3.33 Staff Cards\nEach player has a deck of 21 staff cards. \nEach staff card represents a historic personage with a number value and text describing the special abilities or penal -\nties implemented when the card is played during a conference. Staff cards are played during the meeting to nominate, advance, and debate issues (or to allow play of your Leader card). \nA staff card may never be played during the Meeting Segment \nfor less than its full value, nor may its attributes be ignored or declined, including any applicable special ability or penalty.\nEach player has a Chief of Staff card whose value is variable. \nIn place of a number value, their cards have a star. See 5.25 for more information.\n3.34 Issues\nIssues are the titled markers that specify various game \nactivities that will be nominated during the Agenda \nSegment, advanced and debated during the Meeting Segment, and resolved during the Decision Segment. \nIssues are placed on the table as instructed by a conference card event or when nominated by the players during the Agenda Seg-ment. 4.0 Conference Sequence of Play\nChurchill  is played as a series of conferences. Each conference \nfollows the same set of procedures. A conference has three phases: the Conference, War, and Post-Mortem Phases.

Players who are told to commit produc-tion to a particular activity or theater during a later portion of the conference should place a production marker at the specified location as a mnemonic. Some conferences will put a specified issue or two in the center of the conference table.\nNext each player deals themselves seven staff cards.

Then each player in turn, starting to the left of the player who won the Agenda Segment, picks two issues and places them in the center of the conference table display. \nPLAY NOTE: There will always be a minimum of seven issues in a conference, with additional issues placed due to confer -\nence card instructions.\nEXMAPLE: Roosevelt wins the Agenda Segment with a 4 value card. The low 1-value card was played by Stalin; Roosevelt chooses the Global issue and places it on the US national track 3 space. Churchill (to Roosevelt\u2019 s left) now picks any two avail -\nable issues and places them on the center of the conference table (zero space). Then Stalin picks two issues, and finally Roosevelt picks two more issues to conclude the segment.\n4.22 Meeting Segment: This is the heart of the conference. \nBeginning with the player to the left of the one who won the Agenda Segment, each Leader plays one staff card and advances an issue toward their position (see advancing an issue, 5.22). All Meeting Segment activities follow the same basic procedure. You play a staff card and move the issue a number of spaces equal to the staff card\u2019s value, plus text bonuses/penalties toward your leader\u2019s chair on the conference display. When an issue is ad-vanced beyond the length of the track, it is said to be off the table and that player has won that issue for this conference (see 5.23).\nEach time an issue is advanced, it may be debated by one of the \nother players, with the player to the left having the first option to debate. The debating player follows the same procedure: play a staff card and move the issue a number of spaces equal to the staff card\u2019s value, including special abilities/penalties, toward their chair. (Keep in mind the USSR national characteristic, which adds one to the value of any staff card used in a debate.) If neither player debates the issue, play proceeds clockwise to the next player. Play continues in this manner until all players have used all of their seven staff cards. Important: When you use your Leader to advance an issue, you can only be debated by another active Leader.\nA player who, since his last opportunity to play a card to advance \nan issue, debated another player\u2019s issue may, during their next opportunity to advance an issue, decide to pass instead; this is to avoid having your hand run out well before the others. This pass may not be saved for future use, and a player only receives one pass, whether they debated once or twice before their next advance-an-issue opportunity.\n4.23 Decision Segment: At the conclusion of the Meeting Seg-\nment each player counts the number of issues that they have \nwon. An issue is won if it resides either on the player\u2019s chair (off the table) or on his national track. The player who won the most issues wins the conference and receives a conference vic-tory marker. In case of ties follow the tiebreaker procedure (4.5).The Decision Segment is broken into seven activities done in this order: \n1. Directed Offensive Placement \n2. Conditional Issues Determination\n3. Production \n4. Production Allocation\n5. Theater Leadership\n6. A-Bomb Research\n7.

A player is finished once he has allocated all production. (See 6.4, Production Allocation, for further details.)\n4.23.5 Theater Leadership Issues\nThe holder of each of the theater commands (US or UK) gains \none offensive/naval support. If either or both of the Theater Leadership issues (Europe and Pacific) were included in this conference, the player(s) who won these issues will receive two bonus offensive/naval support and determine whether the US or UK will command that theater (see 6.9, for further details).\n4.23.6 A-Bomb Research Issues\nIf the A-Bomb Research issue was included in this conference, \nthe player who won this issue rolls a six-sided die as modified by production allocation to determine if the US A-Bomb pawn is advanced toward the Trinity space. If Stalin (USSR) won this issue they also advance the Soviet A-Bomb pawn (no die roll) one space toward the Trinity space (see 6.10, for further details).\n4.23.7 Global Issue\nIf the Global Issue was included in this conference, \nthe player who won the issue moves one of his two Global Issue markers toward his position, if possible. A player may not choose to avoid moving a marker \ntoward his position if he won the Global Issue. If both markers are already in a player\u2019s advantage position, no action is taken. (See 6.11, Global Issues, for further details.)\n4.3 War Phase\nThe War Phase consists of three segments: Clandestine, Politi -\ncal, and Military.\n4.31 Clandestine Segment: Players take turns plac-\ning all of their Clandestine Networks at once. The \nplayer with the greatest number of Clandestine Network markers to place goes first, followed by the player with the second most, followed by the third player.\nEach player automatically receives one Clandestine Network \nfor his or her secret service activities. Additional Clandestine Networks may be gained by means of conference, leader, and staff cards and allocating production to won Pol-Mil issues.\nNew Clandestine Networks are either placed in countries with \nno networks belonging to other players or are expended on a one-to-one basis to remove another player\u2019s clandestine existing networks. Only one player may have Clandestine Networks in a country or colony at a time, up to two maximum. \n4.32 Political Segment: Players take turns placing all of their Political Alignment markers at once. As with Clandestine Networks earlier, the player with the great-est number of Political Alignment markers to place goes \nfirst, followed by the player with the second most, followed by the third player.\nPlayers gain Political Alignment markers by means of confer -\nence, leader, and staff cards and allocating production to won \nPol-Mil issues.\nNew Political Alignment markers are either placed in countries \nwith no Political Alignment marker belonging to other players or are expended on a one-to-one (or two-to-one, depending on the current Global Issue status; see 6.11) basis to remove another player\u2019s existing Political Alignment markers. In order to either place or remove a Political Alignment marker, the acting player must have a Clandestine Network in that country or colony. A country or colony can have only one Political Alignment marker. Note: Global Issue positions may restrict where and how Political Alignment markers may be placed.\nDue to Clandestine Network removal and placement, a country \nor colony may legally have Clandestine Networks from one player and a Political Alignment marker from another. This condition can persist indefinitely and the player who owns the \nPolitical Alignment marker will score the VPs for that space at the end of the game.\n4.33 Military Segment\nThe Military Segment is divided into Axis reserve deployment \nand Front advancement. \n1.

The Axis reserve deployment uses deployment priorities to \nsend enemy reserves to oppose various Fronts. There are two kinds of Axis reserves, naval and army. Each naval reserve deployed eliminates one Allied naval marker. Each army reserve deployed effectively cancels one offensive support marker or, if none are present, automatically prevents the Front from advancing.\n2. After Axis reserve deployment, each Front must attempt to advance by rolling a ten-sided die. For Fronts with strength less than 10, advance the Front one space if the die roll is less than or equal to the Front\u2019s strength. Fronts with strength of 10 or greater will have a chance of advancing two spaces (see 7.74). After all eligible Fronts have attempted to advance, the conference is concluded.

Roll a six-sided die and add it to 15 (new value will be 16 to 21). If the difference between the high score and the low score is equal to or less than this new value, the player with the high score wins. If the difference between the high score and the low score is greater than this new value, the player with the second highest score wins the game.\nPLAY NOTE: If you do the math, you\u2019ll notice that if the initial score difference is 22 or more then the player with the second highest score will win the game.\nTournament Scoring: If the point spread between the highest and the lowest score is greater than 15 points, the player with the second highest score wins.\n4.43 Condition 3: If either Axis power has not surrendered, \nthen each player rolls a six-sided die and modifies their score accordingly:\n\u2022 The player with the highest score subtracts the die roll value \nfrom their score.\n\u2022 The player with the second-highest  score subtracts half the \ndie roll value (round up) from their score.\n\u2022 The player with the lowest score adds the die roll value  to \ntheir score.\nIn case of a tie for first, both players subtract the value of a six-\nsided die. In case of a tie for second, both players add the value of a six-sided die to their die roll. The player with the highest score after this score adjustment wins the game. If the final score is tied, follow the Final Game Victory tiebreaker procedure below (4.44).\nTournament Scoring: After subtracting 5 points from the player \nin first place, the player with the high score wins.\nDESIGN NOTE: Players have to win the game within an alliance structure. A cutthroat winner-take-all style of play may result in the most points but could drive your Allies into a pact against you in the peace to come; hence why the second-place score wins in condition 2, as they become the leader of a two-power coalition against the most powerful nation. Condition 3 should be considered a loss for the alliance, but heralds a potential deal being cut with the former Axis power for leverage in the peace to come, but again the leaders take a VP shave before the final tally. To win the peace you have to play a subtle game to win by a close, cooperative score or suffer the ensuing world chaos where the nation with the initial post-war advantage is hard to predict. \n4.44 Final Game Victory Tiebreaker: In case there is a tie for \nthe most VPs, after any adjustments, the Final Game tiebreaker priorities are as follows. The first condition to be met breaks the tie; ignore any subsequent conditions.\n1. If the US is tied for the lead and has the A-Bomb (i.e., the \nA-Bomb Research track is at Trinity), Roosevelt/Truman wins.2. If the USSR is tied for the lead and its East Front tank is the sole occupier of Germany, Stalin wins.\n3. Otherwise, Churchill wins, even if Churchill was not one of the sides tied for the lead.\n4.5 Tiebreaker Procedure \nThe following is used for all tiebreak situations except determin-ing the winner of the game:\n4.51 During the Agenda Segment if two or three staff cards have \nthe same final value (remembering to include the UK national characteristic +1 bonus), starting with Stalin and proceeding to the left, a player can decide to use their active Leader to break the tie. The first Leader to commit breaks the tie, and no further Leader can change the outcome. In the circumstance where a player uses their leader to break a tie that they were not involved in, they choose who wins the tie. \n4.52 During the Decision Segment if two or more players have \nwon the same number of issues, starting with Stalin and proceed-ing to the left, a player can decide to use their active Leader to break the tie. The first Leader to commit breaks the tie, and no further Leader can change the outcome.

In the circumstance where a player uses their leader to break a tie that they were not involved in they choose who wins the tie.\nNote that in both situations the tiebreaking Leader will be inac -\ntive for the rest of the conference.4.53 If no player uses their Leader to break a tie as above, then \nrefer to the US player\u2019s national characteristic (Arsenal of Democracy): if the US was involved in the tie, he wins the tie; if the US was not involved, he decides which of the other two players wins the tie.\n4.6 Five Mississippi\nThe game can be tedious if players think too deeply on the placement of every marker. If this starts to happen, count five seconds out loud, and if the offending player has not played yet, the player to his left places the marker for him.\n4.7 Negotiations\nThere is no formal negotiations phase or procedure. All conversa-tions must be made in the presence of the other player. No secret negotiations or conversations are allowed during the game. No agreement or conversation is binding. Only player actions during the game are binding.\nPlay Note: Threatening or pleading with your Allies is encour -\naged, but not binding.\nSTOP! \nAt this point you have the basic rules and concepts for playing \na game of Churchill.

The other two players then have the option to debate that issue in order to move the issue back toward the center and toward their side of the table. This sequence continues until all staff cards have been played.\n5.22 Advancing an Issue\nOn a player\u2019s turn, he plays one staff card from his hand. The \nplayer selects any one un-captured issue (see 5.23) on the table and moves it a number of spaces equal to the staff card\u2019s value, modified according to the card\u2019s attributes. That player must also implement any other attributes on the staff card.\nPLAY NOTE: You can never play a staff card during the Meet -\ning Segment for less than its full value to include any applicable attribute or national characteristic bonuses, unless the staff card text says otherwise (e.g., Harry Hopkins).\nIf the selected issue is in the center space or on the active player\u2019s track, move the issue a number of spaces towards his leader\u2019s conference chair. If the selected issue is on another player\u2019s track, the player must move it towards the center space, before moving it along his own track. (If the staff card\u2019s modified value is great enough, he may move it along both an opponent\u2019s track and his track.)\nWhen a conditional issue (\nSecond  Front or USSr declare S War \non Japan) is advanced or debated and enters the center of the \nconference table, the player advancing/debating the conditional \nissue may optionally end movement in the center of the table. This option must be exercised immediately.\nThe Meeting Segment ends when all staff cards have been played. \nIf one player has more than one card remaining, he plays his cards in sequence until he is out of cards.\nDESIGN NOTE: Conferences that prevent a particular Leader from advancing an issue indicates they were not there or were under-staffed at the conference. \nEXAMPLE 1: Churchill plays a 3-value staff card whose attri-bute gives a +1 bonus for production issues. Churchill chooses a Pol-Mil issue on the zero space and moves it on his national track (toward his side of the conference table) to the 3 space. If he had chosen a production issue, he would have moved it to the 4 space due to the staff card attribute bonus.\nEXAMPLE 2: The UK Production marker is on the Soviet 2 \nspace. Churchill plays the same 3-value staff card with the pro-duction bonus and moves the UK Production marker to the British 2 space. The exact method is to move the UK Production marker from the Soviet 2 space to the zero space expending two of the four moves, and then it is moved two spaces toward Churchill.5.23 Capturing an Issue\nIf advancing an issue would move it onto a player\u2019s leader chair \nspace (the track\u2019s seventh space), before it is moved, the other players are first given a chance to debate the issue. If neither chooses to debate it, the issue is captured.\nIf the issue is debated, compare the modified values of the staff \ncard used to advance the issue and the staff card used to debate the issue. Move the issue a number of spaces equal to the differ -\nence. Movement is toward the advancing player\u2019s chair if his staff card\u2019s value was greater; it is toward the center if the debating player\u2019s staff card\u2019s value was greater. If the issue is moved on or beyond the leader chair space, the issue is captured.\nA captured issue is no longer available to be advanced or debated \nfor the remainder of this conference.\nPLAY NOTE: Another way of thinking about this is to imagine that the track extends beyond the chair\u2014to eight, nine, ten, or more spaces\u2014and an issue is only captured if it remains, after debates, on or beyond the seventh space. \nEXAMPLE: The USSR Directed Offensive issue is in the US 5 space and the US plays a 4 value staff card to advance the issue into Roosevelt\u2019 s chair. The Soviets declare they want to debate the issue and play a 2 value card with +1 for Soviet national characteristic. The difference between the US 4 value and the USSR 3 value is one for the US, so the issue moves one space toward Roosevelt into the US 6 space.

Place a Pass marker on the player\u2019s discard pile until his next turn as a reminder. When it comes his turn, if he chooses not to exercise this option, he cannot save the option for his next turn. \nEven if a player has debated twice since his last turn, he can \nnonetheless only earn a single option to pass per turn.\nDESIGN NOTE: Debating an issue simulates the intense disagreements that arose during a conference on key issues such as post-war borders (Political Alignment), support of partisans (\nclandestine  networks ), and the timing for D-Day \n(second  Front). By reducing how much an issue advances \ntoward your Ally, a player in essence is metaphorically mak-ing a stronger argument or at least taking some of the steam out of an argument. \nPLAY NOTE: It should be obvious that if the US or UK player is directly to the left of an issue advance they can just as eas-ily wait and advance the same issue on their next card play. The main value of the debate is four-fold. First, to prevent the outright capture of an issue; second the Soviets gain a one strength increase when they debate; third, the player who is two to the left creates a dynamic where the player to the left may keep the issue closer to the center of the table, and lastly it offers a player the opportunity for a double move with the loss of card count. \n5.25 Chief of Staff Cards\nEach side has a Chief of Staff card (Brooke, Marshall, Zhukov) \nwhose value is variable. Each time a Chief of Staff card is played, its value is equal to the roll of a six-sided die. This value is then increased or decreased by applicable modifiers.\nA player must commit to playing his Chief of Staff card before \ndetermining his value, but, if advancing, he is not required to choose which issue to advance until after determining his value.\nDESIGN NOTE: Chiefs of Staff held powerful positions but were often constrained by their boss (the Leader), who they did not always agree with. Plus they had to be politically astute to avoid driving too hard on an issue and damaging future cooperation with their foreign counterparts. To simulate these subtleties of a Chief of Staff, his impact varies from conference to conference and is simply captured by a random die roll. \n5.26 Using Leaders to Advance or Debate an Issue\nIf his Leader is active for this conference, a player may advance \nor debate an issue with his Leader card. To do so he discards one of his staff cards and uses the Leader\u2019s card value and attributes instead. Attributes, bonuses, or penalties from the discarded staff card are not implemented. A player may only use his Leader once per conference. Once used, move him to the inactive position.PLAY NOTE: During some conferences a particular player\u2019 s Leader card is prohibited from advancing an issue. This in-ability does not prevent that Leader from debating an issue or breaking ties, but he may not initiate the process by advancing an issue.\nEXAMPLE: the A-Bomb Research issue is on the zero space and both Churchill and Stalin are inactive due to prior use. Roosevelt discards a card and announces that he is using his Leader card for its 7 value. Since the Leader cannot be debated by a staff card \nRoosevelt moves the A-Bomb Research issue to his side of the \ntable capturing the issue. Then Roosevelt must make a health die roll (as noted on his card), which he survives. Move Roosevelt\u2019 s marker to his chair\u2019 s inactive position.\n5.27 Concluding the Meeting Segment\nAfter the last staff card has been played, the Meeting Segment \nis over. Each player now wins any issues on his track and places \nthem on his leader\u2019s chair. If \nSecond  Front , USSr declareS  \nWar on Japan, or Strategic  MaterialS  are in the center space, \ntheir effects will be implemented according to special rules in \nthe Decision Segment (see 6.21, 6.22, and 6.3, respectively).

The order of placement starts with the player to the left of the conference winner and proceeds clockwise.\nPLAY NOTE: Directed Offensives will later determine where players will be required to allocate production markers (see 6.4)\n6.2 Conditional Issues\nThere are two conditional issues: Second  Front  and USSr de-\nclareS  War on Japan. A conditional issue can be won like any \nother issue, but a conditional issue takes effect only if it ended the conference in the center space of the conference table.\n6.21 Second Front\nThe Second  Front  issue is only available until the \nWestern Front enters the Normandy space, after \nwhich it is removed from the game.\nThe Western Front cannot attempt entry into the Normandy space unless it ended in the center of the table during this conference . \nIf the Normandy space is not successfully entered during this Conference\u2019s War Segment, the \nSecond  Front  issue must again \nbe nominated and end in the center of the table in order for entry to be attempted in a subsequent conference.\nDESIGN NOTE: Consider a first failure of D-Day to repre-sent Dieppe.\nPLAY NOTE: The UK gains VPs if the Mediterranean Front enters Central Italy before D-Day occurs, so there may be in-centive to delay D-Day. The Soviets have most of the German army opposing them, so their incentive is to weigh in on the debate to support an early D-Day in order to divert resources to the Western Front. When D-Day will occur depends on player interaction, and while it can occur during the London Confer -\nence (June 1944), circumstances may accelerate or delay it. \n6.22 USSR Declares War on Japan\nThe USSr declare S War on Japan issue is only avail-\nable until the Soviet Far East Front enters the Manchu-ria space, after which it is removed from the game.\nThe Far East Front cannot attempt entry into the Manchuria space unless it ended in the center of the table during this conference . \nIf the Manchuria space is not successfully entered during this Conference\u2019s War Segment, the \nUSSr declareS  War on Japan \nissue must again be selected and end in the center of the table in order for entry to be attempted in a subsequent conference.\nDESIGN NOTE: A successful USSr declare S War on Japan \nplay that does not result in the Far East Front advancing into Manchuria represents the uncertain time period between when Stalin agreed to the declaration and when hostilities were initiated in the Far East. 6.3 Production\n6.31 Base Production Values \nPlayers receive a base number of production markers each \nConference: \n \n     \n     \n    \n x4 x6 x3\n6.32 Additional Production MarkersEach player can gain additional production markers as follows:\nFor each production issue named for a player and won by another \nplayer, the winning player receives one production marker from the named player. If a player won his own production issue, there is no effect.\nIf the Strategic  MaterialS  \nissue ended the conference in the center space, all three players receive their strate -\ngic material production marker. If it was won by a particular player, only he receives the additional production marker.\nThe USSR gains a production marker if the Arctic Theater box \nhas three or more naval markers.\nThe USSR may gain a production marker due to the Murmansk \nConvoy, as per the current conference card.\nEXAMPLE: Roosevelt wins the US \nProduction  issue as a de-\nfensive move to keep control of his production.

Directed Offensives (two production markers each; see 6.7)\nAfter these two priorities have been satisfied, a player can freely \nallocate his remaining production markers to place offensive support and naval support markers (6.5), activate Pol-Mil issues (6.8), and gain modifiers for A-Bomb Research (6.10).\nIn addition to allocating production markers at this time, on \ntheir turn players also place offensive support and naval support markers gained through theater leadership (6.9).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4679, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d733a1d6-a8e6-4810-8d89-b19308d1b996": {"__data__": {"id_": "d733a1d6-a8e6-4810-8d89-b19308d1b996", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "664267d8-aeef-4b17-8f79-6f64d2f17ecf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "a37a827cc2b940cd55259e368abaa3dd86fc1fddb1c112ee5e937979b655619f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c64eec34-37eb-4f8c-aecf-c620bd60b14b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "a06a6f995a117bd16ae9fd719a6f01c5d461adaa8f491dea42db2658ff2f5361", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5454c85-8ace-4f28-bc4f-39969462a973", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "76a427bd483040baae023c10ca5d292afcb8651db2b4fae5f26575cc12a6a397", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Churchill Rules12\n\u00a9 2015 GMT Games, LLC\n6.5 Military Support\nOne production marker purchases one offensive support or one \nnaval support marker. Place each offensive support purchased in this way in the entry space of any Front. Place each naval support marker in a theater box. A player may place offensive support and naval support markers in multiple Fronts/theaters.\nA theater box can never have more than five naval markers total. \nA land or amphibious entry space can have an unlimited number of offensive support markers on it.\n6.6 Conference Card Production Allocation\nMany conferences require that one or more production markers be spent in certain theaters on the map display. This is the highest priority for production allocation. \nPLAY NOTE: As a mnemonic a player can place one of his production markers in the indicated location when the Confer -\nence Card is initially drawn.\n6.7 Directed Offensives\nDuring the Military Segment each Front must try to advance towards the Axis powers. A Directed Of-fensive marker can be placed in any entry space to ensure that it receives offensive priority.\n  \n   \n     \n    \n UK US USSR\nEach directed  oFFenSive  issue requires the flag owner (e.g., the \nUK directed  oFFenSive  marker shown) to allocate production \nmarkers to place two offensive support or naval support markers.\ndirected  oFFenSive  markers on a land entry space can only be \nsatisfied with offensive support markers.\ndirected  oFFenSive  markers on an amphibious entry space must \nbe satisfied with naval markers until there are three naval support markers in the theater (five, if the entry space is Normandy); with offensive support thereafter.\nA player must fully allocate as many production markers to \ndirected  oFFenSiveS as he is able, including only partial satisfac-\ntion, if necessary. If a player does not have enough production \nmarkers to satisfy all of his directed  oFFenSiveS, he may choose \nwhich ones to allocate to first, leaving the remainder unsatisfied or partially satisfied at no penalty.\nDESIGN NOTE: Placing a USSR directed  oFFensive  in \nfront of a US Front simulates the US getting the Soviets to agree to forego military aid to enable the invasion of France. Remember, if Germany and Japan do not both surrender, the situation can become somewhat chaotic and potentially unpredictable, so some level of cooperation and coercion is sometimes required to defeat the Axis. \nEXAMPLE: With the \nsecond  Front issue in the center of the table, \nStalin decides to place the US directed  oFFensive  in France to \nreduce in the future the number of German reserves allocated to the Eastern Theater (by making sure the Allies land in Nor -mandy). There are four naval support markers in the Western Theater box. Due to the D-Day requirement for five naval sup-port markers, the US satisfies the \ndirected  oFFensive  with two \nproduction markers and places one naval marker in the Western Theater box, to meet the D-Day minimum of five naval, and one offensive support in Normandy.\n6.8 Activating Pol-Mil Issues\nPlayers may activate won political -Military  (Pol-\nMil) issues to receive Political Alignment markers and Clandestine Network markers, which will be placed during the War Segment (7.1, 7.3). A \npol-\nMill iSSUe that is not activated has no effect.\n6.81 Each pol-Mil issue is marked as X/Y and can be activated \nby allocating a production marker to it. When activated, the player receives X Political Alignment markers and Y Clandestine Networks.\n6.9 Theater Leadership\nThere are two theater commands, Europe and the Pacific. Each can be controlled by either the US or the UK, and control can change multiple times over the course of the game.

Roosevelt does not give up the leadership and gains two offensive support or naval support markers for winning the Pacific Leadership  issue and one offen -\nsive support or naval support marker for the Pacific Command. All three markers must be placed in the Pacific Theater.\nSince the ussr \ndeclares  war on JaPan issue ended the confer -\nence in the center of the table at the end of this conference, the \nSoviet Far East Front must attempt to advance into Manchuria and beyond. Roosevelt decides to meet one of the Emperor\u2019 s Sur -\nrender conditions by placing all three offensive support markers on the Manchuria space to help Stalin to aid in the defeat of Japan whether he likes it or not.\n6.10 A-Bomb Research\nIf the a-B oMB reSearch  issue was won, roll a six-\nsided die and apply any modifiers (6.10.2). On a result of 4-6 advance the US A-Bomb marker one space toward the Trinity space. \nOnce the US marker enters the final A-Bomb track space the US and the UK have the A-Bomb, which has various implications for Japanese surrender (7.82) and VPs.\n6.10.1 Manhattan Spy Ring\nIf Stalin wins the issue, in addition to the die roll above, automati-\ncally advance, without a die roll, the Soviet Manhattan Project spy marker one space on the A-Bomb track.\nPLAY NOTE: The Soviet Manhattan Project spy marker can move ahead of the actual A-Bomb marker as it represents steal-ing of technology not actual hardware. The A-Bomb marker represents the actual engineering progress on constructing a bomb.\n6.10.2 A-Bomb Research Issue Modifier\nAny player may allocate production markers for a +1 modifier per \nproduction marker to the A-Bomb Research advancement die roll.\nPLAY NOTE: The expenditure of three production markers (+3 die roll modifier) will make the A-Bomb Research advance-ment automatic.6.11 Global Issues\nDESIGN NOTE: Across all of the conferences there were a number of global issues that spoke directly to the structure of the post-war world and were debated and discussed from the dark days of Axis expansion right up through the final confer -\nence. Churchill\u2019 s \u2018naughty document\u2019 (sometimes also called the \u2018naughty note\u2019) was an agreement between Churchill and Stalin to create de facto spheres of influence in Europe that infuriated the Americans and undermined the post-war peace.\nEach player has two \ngloBal iSSUeS that they metaphorically \ndebate bilaterally with one of the other players, as represented by the Global Issue connections on the conference table. The marker for each of the three \ngloBal  iSSUeS  is either in the center \n(neutral) location or in a player\u2019s advantage position. Movement of a Global Issue marker from its neutral space alters some of the rules for placing Political Alignment markers, but has no effect on Clandestine Networks. \nIMPORTANT! In all cases a conference card text that requires \nthe placement or removal of a Political Alignment marker takes priority over any Global Issue restrictions. Global Issue restric -\ntions remain in force for all other situations.\nA player who wins a Global Issue moves one of his two Global \nIssue markers towards himself, either from the starting neutral position to his advantage or from his opposition\u2019s advantage to \nhis advantage. Once a Global Issue marker leaves the neutral location it never re-enters that location and is thereafter in one player\u2019s advantage position or the other.\nPLAY NOTE: If both of a player\u2019 s Global Issue advantage locations already have markers on them and he has won the Global Issue, they do not move and there is no additional benefit. A player in this situation is protecting his global issue advantage positions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4566, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26a2f42f-e646-4d03-9bbf-f8fca006cf43": {"__data__": {"id_": "26a2f42f-e646-4d03-9bbf-f8fca006cf43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8b4a8d52-8d3d-4d1f-8d15-0688f392127a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "f98f5aaf07e4ea86004963753533f445704eefefb4b19400767463cb3c1b9ee0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fdcaa07-ce51-4ec2-b09e-1e9c10a18216", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "616ac9e125ae9bd4310137864cc20022845e29a9f4d49c578aa856c28186fce8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee7c746e-376f-4780-8d7a-948fa051af63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d437861b5a2401e3815582b086eb155efabf7d7ea3544e3bd589e02d9ca2c16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IMPORTANT!

Clandestine Network Segment (7.1)\n2. Political Alignment Segment (7.3)\n3. Military Segment\na. Axis Reserve Placement (7.6)\nb. Advancing a Front (7.7)\n7.1 Clandestine Network Segment\nEach player receives one Clandestine Network, in addition to \nClandestine Networks and Political Alignment markers gained through staff card attributes, conference cards, and activation of Pol-Mil issues in the Decision Segment.\nPLAY NOTE: This represents each nation\u2019 s intrinsic secret operations directorates (e.g., OSS).\nThe player with the largest number of Clandestine \nNetworks to be placed places all of his markers, followed by the player with the second largest \nnumber of Clandestine Network markers, followed by the remain -\ning player. If there is a tie, the US player\u2019s national characteris -\ntic allows him to determine who goes next.\nPLAY NOTE: Though there is an advantage to going last, you can place two Clandestine Networks in a country or colony, creating some resilience against later moves.\nEXAMPLE: Stalin has five Clandestine Networks, Churchill \nhas three and Roosevelt one. Stalin places all of his Clandestine Networks, followed by Churchill and finishing with Roosevelt.7.11 Clandestine Network Placement\nClandestine Networks are placed in country or colony spaces. A \ncountry or colony can never have more than two total Clandes-tine Networks present, and they may only be of a single nation.\nClandestine Networks and Political Alignment markers can be \nplaced in a country or colony even if the Front marker has not \narrived at the associated Front Track space yet, and they may con -\ntinue to be placed even after the surrender of Germany or Japan.\n7.12 Clandestine Network Removal\nIf a country or colony already has an opponent\u2019s Clandestine \nNetwork present, a player may discard one of his own un-played Clandestine Networks, in lieu of playing it, to remove an op-ponent\u2019s Clandestine Network.\nDESIGN NOTE: The removal of an opposing player\u2019 s Clan-destine Network should not always be viewed as a military confrontation between two opposing factions, although that did happen in Yugoslavia and Greece. Sometimes the removal of a Clandestine Network represents political manipulation of the situation akin to what happened in Poland when Soviet encouragement caused the Polish Home Army to rise against the Germans in Warsaw and then was left to wither on the vine, while the Soviet forces waited for the Germans to eliminate the west-leaning opposition.\n7.13 Front Effects on Clandestine Networks\nWhere a Front marker is located is known as the Frontline.

It takes a Political Alignment marker to remove it, but the groundwork for a change in alignment is now in place.\n7.3 Political Alignment\nEach player possessing Political Alignment markers places them in countries or colonies where he has Clandestine Networks. \nPlayers take turns placing all of their Political Alignment \nmarkers at once. As with Clandestine Networks earlier, the player with the greatest number of Political Align-ment markers to place goes first, followed by the player \nwith the second most, followed by the third player. A player places all of his markers before play passes to the next player.\n7.31 Political Alignment Marker Placement\nA player may place Political Alignment markers in any country or \ncolony where he has at least one Clandestine Network (including those placed this turn). Do not remove the Clandestine Networks when placing the Political Alignment marker. A country or colony can never have more than one Political Alignment marker. \nDESIGN NOTE: Political Alignment markers for spaces not behind the front represent a Government in exile or Communist cadre gaining sufficient influence to run the country after it is liberated.\n7.32 Political Alignment Marker Removal\nIn a country or colony where a player has a Clandestine Network, \nhe may discard one (or more, depending on the current Global Issue statuses; see 6.11) of his own unplayed Political Alignment markers, in lieu of playing it, to remove another player\u2019s Political Alignment marker in that country/colony.\nEXAMPLE: Hungary has a USSR Political Alignment marker \nand a UK Clandestine Network. Churchill can use one Politi -\ncal Alignment marker to remove the USSR Political Alignment \nmarker and if he has a second one available he can place it in Hungary.\n7.4 Arctic Theater\nThe Arctic Theater is a special situation in terms of the political conflict. The Arctic Theater has no Front or Front Track; players may only place naval support markers, not offensive support markers in the Arctic Theater. \nNo Political Alignment markers or Clandestine Networks can \nbe placed in Norway or Finland if the Arctic Theater has fewer than three naval support markers. If there are three or more naval support markers present in the Arctic Theater, all players can play Clandestine Networks and Political Alignment markers in Norway and Finland. When the Arctic Theater has three or more naval support markers present, the USSR receives an additional production marker in the Decision Segment.\nIf there are Clandestine Networks and Political Alignment \nmarkers in Norway and/or Finland and the number of naval support markers is fewer than three, the markers present are not affected, but no new markers may be placed or removed until the Arctic Theater once again has three or more naval support markers present.\n7.5 Fronts\n7.51 Each player has Front markers that he controls. \nThe US controls the Western, Central Pacific, and Southwest Pacific Fronts. The UK controls the Mediterranean and CBI (China-Burma-India) \nFronts. The Soviets control the Eastern and Far East Fronts. No one controls the Arctic Theater box.\n7.52 Fronts move on Front Tracks that are associated with a \ntheater box. A Front Track space may be associated with a set of countries and colonies. As a Front advances it controls the space it occupies and all Front spaces between its location and its theater box. The final space on each Front Track is either Germany or Japan (with the exception of the Mediterranean Front Track).\n7.53 A Front marker is either on a Front Track or is in a theater \nbox. (If the latter, it will attempt to advance onto the Front Track itself this conference.) To advance on the Front Track into an adjacent Front Track space requires a successful military cam-paign die roll.

A really strong Front has an increased chance of a breakthrough.\nPLAY NOTE: Once a Front\u2019 s strength is 10 or greater it has a 100% chance of advancing.

There are three different cards for each of the ten historical conferences. Based on the scenario being played, take the three copies of all of the conferences starting with Conference 10: Terminal and randomly and pick one, place it facedown to form the bottom of the deck, and place the other two copies of Terminal unexamined to the side. None of the players should know which card was selected. Then take Conference 9 and conduct the same process placing the chosen conference card on top of Conference 10. Repeat this procedure for each conference that is included in the scenario creating a conference card deck with one copy of each conference in the stack, and then continue with set up. \nEXAMPLE: In the tournament scenario, secretly choose one \nof the three Terminal conference cards, and then continue with Conference 9, then 8 etc. ending with London, Conference 6. These five conference cards comprise the conference deck for the game with the other versions put to the side unexamined.\n9.3 Scenario Victory\nAt the conclusion of the tenth conference or any conference if both Axis powers have surrendered, the game is over and the winner is determined. At the game end all players determine their final VP score. See 4.4 for how to determine the final score.\n9.4 Victory Point Schedule\nGeneral\nA. 3 VP per country or colony space with your Political \nAlignment marker\nB. 1 VP  per country space without a Political Alignment marker \nwhere you have a Clandestine Network\nC. 5 VP per Global Issue on your advantage position on the track\nD. 3 VP per conference victory marker won by US/UK \nE. 5 VP per conference victory marker won by USSR\nColonies\nF. 2 VP for UK per colony space with no Clandestine Network \nor Political Alignment marker\nAxis Surrender\nG. 8 VP per Axis country where they have a Front (all US and \nUK Fronts give 8 points to both the US and the UK)Europe\nH. 2 VP for the UK if Front in Central Italy \nI. 3 VP for UK if Front in Northern Italy\nJ. 2 VP for US if UK Front in Northern Italy \nK. 3 VP for the UK if Central Italy is entered before Normandy \n(if during same conference, 0 VP)\nL. 2 VP for the US if Normandy is entered before Central Italy (if during same conference, 0 VP)\nM. 5 VP for USSR if Germany surrenders and is not occupied by a US-UK Front (in addition to the 8 for being in Germany space)\nN. 5 VP for the USSR and the US/UK each if they fail to reach Germany, but reach East or West Germany respectively\nO. 2 VP for the USSR and the US/UK each if they fail to reach Germany, but reach Prussia or the Rhineland respectively\nP. 1 VP  per German Technology marker (received when \nGermany surrenders)\nPacific\nQ. 5 VP for US if Japan surrenders and is not occupied by any \nFront\nR. 3 VP for the UK and the USSR if the SW Pacific Front has not entered the Philippine space during the game (i.e., MacArthur has not returned)\nS. 5 VP for UK and USSR if the Central or SW Pacific is more than one space further away from Japan than the other (US Inter-service Rivalry) \nT. 5 VP for the US if Okinawa is captured\nU. 5 VP for the US if Kyushu is captured\nV. 5 VP for the UK if Formosa is captured\nW. 8 VP for the USSR if Korea is captured\nA-Bomb\nX. 3 VP for the USSR for each space achieved for the Manhattan \nspy ring marker (potential of 12)\nY. 3 VP for the US and UK if the US marker is in the Trinity A-Bomb space\nZ. 3 VP for the USSR if the US does not have the A-Bomb (US has not reached the Trinity space on the A-Bomb track\nIMPORTANT!", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3930, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35f72fdb-29bf-45a5-a9cb-2de21748fd91": {"__data__": {"id_": "35f72fdb-29bf-45a5-a9cb-2de21748fd91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef11ccc-8629-487b-89ca-4208681baf89", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "43df3a73a7f25ea078656a1c21fc0793edfe03b4eeb68f7d38acfb15db6c35fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b57ff44-58bf-47f4-a450-d7de5a8321e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "5f2bd0edb3408a6310ad42c0d50b8fe2e56673d73946524c6ac89907377a5ed4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0554efd4-f94f-4a5d-9abf-3c4cb676ce6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5cc524fd2102866d7ed3146bb50a0d6eeaa61f39eaa8519e440764525ad92e06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5 VP for UK and USSR if the Central or SW Pacific is more than one space further away from Japan than the other (US Inter-service Rivalry) \nT. 5 VP for the US if Okinawa is captured\nU. 5 VP for the US if Kyushu is captured\nV. 5 VP for the UK if Formosa is captured\nW. 8 VP for the USSR if Korea is captured\nA-Bomb\nX. 3 VP for the USSR for each space achieved for the Manhattan \nspy ring marker (potential of 12)\nY. 3 VP for the US and UK if the US marker is in the Trinity A-Bomb space\nZ. 3 VP for the USSR if the US does not have the A-Bomb (US has not reached the Trinity space on the A-Bomb track\nIMPORTANT!

Some folks like know-ing the exact score at all times and manage their decisions based on perfect \u2018score\u2019 information, while others like a bit more uncertainty. The core game uses perfect scoring but for those who like to have a bit more bluff in their games I offer the following official variant.\n10.1 Secret Agenda Markers\n \u2018Secret Agenda\u2019 markers are marked as such and also have the name of a country or colony on one side. Note that there are some duplicates for some countries/colonies; this is intentional and these are not extras.\n10.2 Secret Agenda Procedure\nTake the 36 Secret Agenda markers; each player secretly and randomly draws three markers. Do not show them to your op-ponents. At the end of the game before you determine the winner, all players reveal their Secret Agenda markers.10.3 Secret Agenda Scoring\nIf at the end of the game a player has a Political Alignment marker in a country/colony that matches one of their Secret Agenda markers they score five additional points per marker, for a potential of 15 points if all three markers meet this condition. After these points have been applied to each players score the winner is determined.\nPLAY NOTE: It is possible and intentional that the application of the Secret Agenda marker bonus could impact the condition under which the winner is determined, i.e., creates a 15 point difference in score that can change the winner. This fact needs to be incorporated into a player\u2019 s strategy, so be careful how hard you fight for your Secret Agenda.\nPLAY NOTE: You score 5 VP per Secret Agenda marker, so if you have two markers for the same location, you would score 10 VP .\nStalin and Churchill enjoy a private moment during the Yalta Conference.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1880, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2073bb2-be42-4f9c-987f-d9da2a19a206": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2073bb2-be42-4f9c-987f-d9da2a19a206", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8663223c-4296-449f-a7b3-680d4bc20a91", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "b179006616562fe563dcdfb92b413c48f08aeb5dd2b34fc9cbc12ce6c41f558b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21a4def6-5637-47d4-9762-db601c5a7d10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3e3d9047498956e0b59d797dcab428c73e9a6c169b9bcda15047159425e259ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e56ca5ff-200d-4f7d-8c2d-5e2cc0f49e16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf0557014a4da6547c94592f40d61b88afee0409948c7fb6e04691bfc26fc5a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Churchill Rules23\n\u00a9 2015 GMT Games, LLC\n11.0 Solitaire Rules\nChurchill  can be played by zero to three players. When you are \nplaying with fewer than three humans use the artificial decision \naids to play the non-human opponents, hereafter called, \u2019Bots. \n2-Player:  Decide either randomly or by choice which side is the \n\u2019Bot (short for robot \u00e0 la Heinlein).Solitaire: Decide who you want to play with the remaining posi -\ntions taken by the \u2019Bots.\u2019Bots at War: A sometimes amusing experience or training aid \nwhereby the \u2019Bots play each other with you supplying the physi-cal interface to keep the action moving.\n11.1 General Procedure: \nEach side has a decision tree formatted set of instructions here-after called a \u2019Bot. Each \u2019Bot\u2019s chart is organized into decisions that mirror a conference\u2019s sequence of play. The \u2019Bot will only attempt to make legal moves and if you determine that this is not the case, then ensure legal play.\nThe \u2019Bot is treated like a human player for when its decisions are \nmade during a turn. When it is the \u2019Bot\u2019s turn to do something you find the appropriate section of the chart and you will be presented with a set of priorities organized from highest to low-est. Follow the instructions as closely as follows, randomizing between choices when a clear path is not evident. \n11.2 Common Sense\nThe \u2019Bots are supplied to allow you to play with fewer than three players. The \u2019Bot logic is visible and it should be no problem for a human player to manipulate the \u2019Bot once you understand what it is trying to do. It is based on trying to synthesize good moves into a compressed and useful format. That said, the \u2019Bot decisions may be sub-optimal given a specific situation. When a situation occurs that is not quite covered in the \u2019Bot decision logic, use human judgment to develop several \u2018legal\u2019 choices and randomize an outcome.\nDESIGN NOTE: Based on my recent experiences I have seen the majority of \u2018rules\u2019 questions in other titles occur around \u2018What should the \u2019Bot do vice any issue with the actual rules?\u2019 If your expectation is that the \u2019Bot should be capable of de-feating you, all I can say is I have lost to them on occasion because the other human player did a better job of working the \u2019Bots decision space.\n11.3 Using the \u2019Bot\nOverall the logic for each \u2019Bot entails looking at the \u2019Bot cards and determining what attribute/issue combinations maximize the collective hand\u2019s staff value. For those who are serious players this can take a bit of time or you can gestalt the overall deck with your opponent and agree what issues the \u2019Bot will be best at winning this conference. Regardless, randomize all close calls, and once established move forward with that logic for the remainder of this conference.11.4 Agenda Segment\nEach \u2019Bot starts with the Agenda Segment that leads to a set of priorities for choosing the \u2019Bots agenda card. Begin with the priority numbered 1 and work your way down the list, implement-ing each priority in order. Some priorities will not be necessary due to what has already occurred, and you should skip through these when this happens. Once you have gotten to the last step in the priority list, you will be directed to the logic for picking the other issues for the conference. \n11.5 Conference Segment\nThis section of decisions is broken into three areas: advancing an issue, debating an issue, and how to use the leader (e.g., Churchill). Based on the cards in hand, work your way through the priorities when it is the \u2019Bots turn. All disagreements between the players on what is the next logical play of the \u2019Bot, when it is not crystal clear, should be determined by a die roll, with the winner making the choice he believes fits the \u2019Bots logic.\n11.6 Decision Segment\nThis section lays out how the \u2019Bot will implement the issues it won and those it must react to, such as Directed Offensives. Do not let the \u2019Bot make an illegal move, regardless of what the priorities state. When this happens move onto the next priority. Once all decisions have been made, proceed to the Pol-Mil set of decisions.\n11.7 War Phase\nThe \u2019Bot should have no decisions during this phase beyond the placement of its Clandestine Networks and Political Alignment markers. So the chart just shows the Pol-Mil segment decisions. Front advancement is mandatory based on the map circum-stances, so it does not require any \u2019Bot decisions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4389, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e56ca5ff-200d-4f7d-8c2d-5e2cc0f49e16": {"__data__": {"id_": "e56ca5ff-200d-4f7d-8c2d-5e2cc0f49e16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8663223c-4296-449f-a7b3-680d4bc20a91", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "b179006616562fe563dcdfb92b413c48f08aeb5dd2b34fc9cbc12ce6c41f558b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2073bb2-be42-4f9c-987f-d9da2a19a206", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "2ce81b3c024137e5d8abe4d4efa6d8343168c5334045a19b58fa80e390c09f04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3e95948-968b-4c75-9703-291647818810", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dcfd185d9c05794db2d779ecf2bb470ebb9212d4e32c16cd4d11a8b487909efb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All disagreements between the players on what is the next logical play of the \u2019Bot, when it is not crystal clear, should be determined by a die roll, with the winner making the choice he believes fits the \u2019Bots logic.\n11.6 Decision Segment\nThis section lays out how the \u2019Bot will implement the issues it won and those it must react to, such as Directed Offensives.

In order for a Front to attempt entry into an amphibious entry space, there must be at least three (or five, see D-Day below) naval support markers in the associated Theater box. \nArctic Theater Box: The Arctic Theater box does not connect \nto a Front Track and has no Front marker. Only naval support markers may be placed in the Arctic Theater box. Clandestine Networks and Political Alignment may be placed in Norway and Finland only if there are at least three naval support markers. If there are two or fewer naval support markers in the Arctic Theater box, no Clandestine Network or political activity may occur in Norway or Finland, although in place markers remain when this occurs.\nB29 Base: Several Pacific theater spaces bear the B29 designa-\ntion. Capture of a B29 space is one of the Emperor Surrender conditions. \nBreakthrough: When a Front\u2019s modified strength is 10 or greater \nand the advancement roll is also 10 or greater, the Front advances an extra space so long as the second space is a land space. A Front receives a +1 drm for each point its modified strength is greater than 10.\nCBI: China-Burma-IndiaClandestine Networks: Clandestine Networks represent sup-\nport to partisans and extensive intelligence operations and are a measure of which side has greater influence in an Axis-conquered country or colony.\nConditional Issues: The \nSecond  Front  and the USSr declare S \nWar on Japan issues are conditional issues. Conditional issues \nonly take effect if they end the Meeting Segment in the center \nof the table. Conditional issues have the additional distinction that when a player is advancing or debating these issues and they enter the center of the table, they may at the discretion of the player cease further movement in that center space, superseding the requirement to move the full value of the staff card played.\nConference Display: The conference display is meant to in-\nvoke the image of a circular conference table where the three powers have their metaphorical seat at the table. At the center of the display is an origin point or zero space where most issues are initially placed during the Agenda Segment. Radiating out from the origin point are three tracks (six spaces in length) that connect to each of the players chairs at the table representing a value of seven or more. \nConference Tracks: The track that connects the center of the \nconference table with each of the player\u2019s display chairs is that player\u2019s track. The Soviet track connects Stalin\u2019s chair with the center of the table. The US and UK tracks use the same naming convention.Colony: All colony spaces are in the Pacific and are associated \nwith the CBI Front Track. The five colonies are Siam, Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Laos/Cambodia, and Malaya. They are treated in all ways like a country for clandestine and Political Alignment purposes. Clandestine Networks and Political Alignment can occur in a country or a colony.\nCountry: A country space is associated with a European Front \nTrack like colonies. Clandestine Networks and Political Align-\nment can occur in a country or a colony.\nD-Day: Entry into the Normandy space requires five naval sup-\nport markers (not the usual three markers) as well as the \nSecond  \nFront  issue in the center of the conference table at the conclusion \nof the Meeting Segment.Entry Space: An entry space is a space that a Front is attempting \nto enter (the next empty space between a Front marker and an \nAxis country). Directed Offensive markers and offensive support markers are placed in, and removed from, a Front\u2019s entry space.\nEurope: Any space in the European Theater displayFront: Front markers represent the theater frontlines. For all \nscoring purposes the US Front markers represent both the US \nand UK. The same applies to UK Front markers: they represent both the US and UK. The USSR Front represents the USSR only. All Fronts have a base strength of two that can be increased by offensive support or decreased by Axis reserve markers. When a Front enters an enemy country (e.g., German, Southern Italy, or Japan), that country surrenders.\nFront Track: A Front Track is composed of Front spaces extend -\ning from a theater box toward an Axis country (e.g., Germany, \nItaly, or Japan). Some Front spaces have countries and colonies associated with them.

Some prefer detailed explanations that tend to be dry, longer than it would seem necessary, yet hopefully answer all questions on game play. These rules are in this box, but I have taken the time to try a new path with a narrative set of rules masked as an illustrated example of play that hopefully allow for easier assimilation and are more interesting to read. So, if you are game, read these first and see if the mechanics of the game come to life. Then begin play using just this knowledge and the player aid chart. Worse case you will miss a few fine points, but absorb the flow of the game. If this does not work for you, the traditional methods stand ready to teach you the game the old fashion way.\nThis is not the beginning \nof the end nor is it the end of the beginning\u2026\n                \nWelcome! As Prime Minister it is my happy task to steer you \nthrough the intricacies of power politics. My task is to see the Axis powers defeated with Herr Hitler and Mr. Tojo getting their just rewards at the end of a rope. To do this Roosevelt, Stalin, and I are working together to win the war. We meet periodi -\ncally in conference to plot the course of the war. We do this by discussing and debating issues that result in decisions that set priorities for which of our brave fighting Fronts receive logistic priority as we advance on our enemies. Simultaneously we are supporting clandestine partisan networks and their governments in exile. My goal is to defeat the Axis powers while creating the conditions that\u2014while good for all\u2014still benefit the Empire that I have sworn to protect.

Stalin smiles and says nothing, but then Frank Walker, Roosevelt\u2019s old friend rises and says he is reading a letter with instructions from the President (discard Walker, use Roosevelt in debate). I may have misjudged the situ -\nation as Roosevelt, even when he is not in the room is a force to be reckoned with. \nRoosevelt instructs Walker to directly \ndebate the issue with poor Portal sitting down. Roosevelt\u2019s letter ends any further discussion on this issue with the \npol-Mil \n1/3 issue moving to the American chair, capturing the issue.

He moves \nthe \ngloBal  issue from the Soviet 1 space to my 4 space. Stalin \ndecides to debate Atlee to gain his debate advantage, using his last resource and fore-going his pass.

Normally Ernest could bring this issue back to \nthe center of the table, but Stalin dislikes him and he falls a bit short of the goal moving the issue to the USSR 1 space (5 value minus 1 for issue on Soviet track).\nWith Stalin out of staff the Americans go for the jugular and send \nin the President\u2019s confident Harry Hopkins. Harry picks up the \ngloBal  issue again and moves it to the American 5 space.

Since I won the US production issue, I receive one of the six US production markers to use at my discretion.\nSince Roosevelt won the conference, he decides last on pro -\nduction allocation. It is now up to me to begin the process of \nsetting military priorities. As an example of Allied cooperation, Roosevelt is giving me one additional production boosting my usual four to five production available for deployment. As I failed to acquire the mandate for Pol-Mil action, I now convert all of my production into military operations. Each production gives me one offensive or naval support marker, but it is late in the war and the German and the Japanese navies are no longer significant threats, so I devote all of my resources to the attack. My five production markers convert into five offensive markers and I receive two additional for the European Leadership issue, giving me a grand total of seven. Due to the Conference card I must use one of my five production to support the CBI theater, so one of my seven offensive support markers is placed in Burma. Now that my mandatory obligations have been met I use five to support the Anglo-American drive for Germany as the race for Berlin is on. My last Offensive is placed to support our Mediter -\nranean Front\u2019s drive on Northern Italy.\nStalin earlier failed his Murmansk Convoy die roll as mandated \nby the conference card and therefore does not receive this pro-duction resource. This leaves Stalin with only his base of three and he complains to his fellow Allies that it is hurting the war effort as he must resource the mandated Manchuria offensive with two of them. Roosevelt promises two offensive support markers if he will forgo converting his Pol-Mil issue. Since Stalin must decide before seeing what Roosevelt will do (negotiations and promises are not binding) he gambles and takes the deal. He converts his three production markers into offensives, using two in the Far East and one on the Eastern Front forgoing his hard won Pol-Mil issue. \nThe Americans begins each conference with six production \nmarkers that was reduced to five for the Lend Lease aid given to myself. Franklin converts four of his production into three offensive support and one into naval support. In addition the Americans gain 1 offensive for each of their European and Pa-cific commands for a total of 5 offensive and one naval support. Roosevelt uses his last production marker to convert his Pol-Mil issue into one Political Alignment and three Clandestine Network markers. Roosevelt now views his obligations in a different light and while apologizing profusely to Stalin only places one not two offensive markers to support the Eastern Front, using two on the Western Front, one in the Central Pacific, and one offensive and one naval support for the SW Pacific Front attack on the Philippines. The Allied level of cooperation is breaking down as the war winds to a close.\nThe A-Bomb Research issue would be addressed at this time, \nbut it was not an agenda item in this conference because the Americans are close to conducting a test, so they were not in a hurry. The vigorous debate over the Global issue resulted in Roosevelt\u2019s view holding sway with the creation of the United Nations. This concludes the business of the conference.\nI return to London from Moscow and await developments from \nmy bunker. I first get intelligence on the various clandestine operations. Roosevelt received three Clandestine Networks plus one for his OSS. Stalin had two\u2014one for his NKVD plus the one gained during the conference. I only had one for MI6. The US took the lead and placed Clandestine Networks in Denmark and Malaya. He then chose to use one to remove the Soviet Clandestine Network in Austria and then placed his last one in the now empty Austria. Stalin was deeply upset about Roosevelt\u2019s aggressive moves in Austria and used one of his Clandestine Networks to remove the US one and then used his last one to place his network back in Austria.

The well-resourced Western Front advanced \ninto the Rhineland, but failed to make a breakthrough. the attacks into Northern Italy and Prussia stalled. In the Pacific, the SW Pacific failed to complete the capture of the Philippines, but the Japanese navy sortied and was eliminated at Leyte Gulf after causing the loss of one Allied naval support. Stalin was visibly upset in his dispatches noting that his forces in the Far East failed to advance and the lack of the promised support on the Eastern Front had created a deficit of trust. The two bright spots were the two under resourced Fronts, the CBI (China-Burma-India) and the Central Pacific surprisingly advanced into Burma and Iwo Jima respectively. \nAs I sit here in my bunker contemplating our next moves I see \nthat the next conference is in Yalta. The Americans ran rough-shod over Comrade Stalin and myself at the last conference and I must do better at Yalta. Franklin continues to demonstrate his strong support for self-determination (UK-US Global Issue) at the expense of supporting European rule over its former colonies. It also appears that there is a growing rift developing between Roosevelt and Stalin that I may be able to exploit. On the other hand if we all fall into bickering over resources and priorities we may yet lose this war. On to Yalta\u2026\nLondon, 1944\nHistorical Issue Appendix and Background\nDESIGN NOTE: This game is about telling a complex his-torical narrative without having you do all of the paperwork. The issues represent a wide variety of detailed discussions that took place before, during, and after a conference. To give you a sense of what the issues represent here is a short explanation to make them less abstract. \nThea Ter Leadership : The Soviets always ran their own forces, \nbut the US and the UK created an integrated although at times dysfunctional leadership team. Initially, the British were in charge by virtue of having the majority of Western forces engaged with the Germans. Eventually US forces became the majority and Eisenhower was chosen to lead the team. From the British perspective Brooke was often considered and at one time the SHAEF position was offered to Marshall. \nThe Soviets had little influence on these decisions, but if they put \nthe issue on the table and win it, they are viewed as working be-hind the scenes to influence the situation. A change in leadership, which can occur frequently, should not be literally interpreted as an actual change in personnel but one ally or another gaining sway over the theater strategy. Montgomery often worked to undermine Eisenhower\u2019s broad front strategy vice his narrow thrust option. He would work through Churchill and Brooke to bring political power to his side of the ledger. Several times Eisenhower had to threaten Monty to get him back under control. The offensive support markers awarded for this issue represent not so much new equipment, but concentrating assets in a differ -\nent manner to create offensive potential from available means, such as the redeployment of armies between the army groups.\nproducTion : prodUction  issues represent a change in priorities \nthat shifts new production to some military enterprise. The USSR gaining a production marker translates into new tanks or aircraft from the US or the UK relinquishing some US lend lease for Eastern Front priorities. Think of the Soviets using a UK pro-duction issue to put naval support into the Arctic as convincing the British to commit more resources to the Murmansk convoys. On occasion the UK may decide to contend for additional US support as they did for their Mediterranean strategy. You may decide to fight for your own production issue just to keep con-trol of where your production goes. A good example is the US informing the Soviets that their aid would take a hiatus during the Sicily campaign as the shipping and resources were needed for the Mediterranean.\ndirec Ted offensive : Many conferences resulted in compromis-\nes that led to attacks in various theaters. For example Churchill was always reluctant to expend resources in the CBI as he thought there were better uses for the materiel. To capture this dynamic the US might try to get a UK \ndirected  oFFenSive as a strong-arm \ntactic to gain more support for a CBI advance or an early D-Day as Marshall wanted.

The Soviets wanted to draw German forces off from the Eastern Front and wanted D-Day to occur as soon as possible. General Marshall unrealistically wanted to invade France in 1942 and felt that Churchill\u2019s soft underbelly strategy would delay the invasion until 1944. Churchill slow rolled the Americans on D-Day and only yielded when the pre-ponderance of US materiel forced the decision.\npoL-MiL issue: Is a blend of Political Alignment and Clandes-\ntine Operations.

A prime example was when the Red \nArmies encouraged the Polish underground to rise up in Warsaw, which they dutifully did. The Soviet forces then halted allowing the Germans to siphon off forces to savagely put down the revolt accomplishing the removal of western influenced forces to the benefit of the Soviets post war aspirations in Poland.\npoLiTicaL aLignMenT: Hand in hand with clandestine operations \nare the myriad governments in exile who are trying to liberate their homelands through the Allied war efforts. An example is the Polish government in London led by Sikorsky. The flip side are the Comintern cadres that resided in Moscow who were inserted into power by the Soviet advance into Eastern Europe. One of the major objectives in the game is for you to put your favorite son of a conquered country into power after the war. While the US and the UK agreed on having freely elected governments taking power after the war they did not always agree on which individual they supported. DeGaulle is an example of a contro-versial figure who manipulated the Western Allies better than his French compatriots. The UK policy for Europe stands in contrast to their view of how things should progress in Asia after Japan\u2019s defeat. The manner in which the British handled the situation in French Indo-China enabled the French reentry and the quagmire that followed. In the game the UK gains colonial leverage if the USSR and US ignore shaping the peace in Asia.\nsTra Tegic  MaTeriaLs : Coordinating the production and distri-\nbution of critical strategic materials created efficiencies when it occurred. The UK and US created a special board under the lead-ership of Harry Hopkins to accomplish this. When this marker is won by a player it is assumed that he has done a superior job of coordinating his resources and gains a production marker. If however, this issue remains in the center of the table at the end of the conference it is a sign of allied cooperation and each player gains the use of their Strategic Materials production marker for this conference.\naToMic  research : This issue represents the senior leadership \ntime and production priority being given to the secret Manhat-tan project. While secret it was the focus of several conference conversations between the UK and the US. The need to get the bomb is a standard Roosevelt issue nomination early in the war. For Stalin, winning this issue demonstrates his putting attention on the espionage and industrial efforts associated with building his own A-Bomb. The British while in an historical support role historically can win this issue to gain conference victory otherwise they usually let the USSR and US be diverted by their interaction over this issue.\ngLobaL  issues : A macro-metaphor for the \u2018big picture\u2019. When \na player puts this issue on the table a major post war muscle movement has been initiated. Often during the war they avoided resolving these issues, as they were too controversial. A global is-sue impacts the bilateral relationship between two of the big three.\nussr  decLares  war on Japan : Perhaps one of the bigger \nmistakes by the US was insisting on Soviet participation in the war in Asia. Similarly to the \nSecond  Front , this issue must be \nagreed to by all sides in order for the Soviet Far Eastern Front to advance into Manchuria and beyond. \nThe Big Three pose at the Yalta conference in February 1945.\nDesigner\u2019s Notes\nInspiration for the Design\nAt my core I am a gamer as much as I am a designer.

Roosevelt and Stalin were the other players in this drama, but they had not left an equivalent written legacy, so it was always Churchill\u2019s voice I heard as I worked through the design.\nEarly on it was easy for me to see the obvious points of contention \nbetween the western Allies and Stalin. For there to be a historical simulation there needed to be a legitimate three way dynamic or the game narrative would not work. As I read more deeply on the subject it appeared that the situation was far more complex than the common myths would suggest. For me the design issue was whether this was a two or a three player game. Said another way, what were the points of severe disagreement required for this to become a three-player game.\nFor me the history was best viewed as three bilateral relation -\nships.

Churchill\u2019s naughty document that Stalin tacitly agreed \nto laid out a post war spheres of influence regime that caused a major rift with the United States. Roosevelt seems to have viewed Stalin as a necessary evil, but it is unclear how he saw things progressing due to his death two months after Yalta. It is clear that Churchill and Roosevelt had a deep personal relationship yet I found it revealing that as the war progressed they found themselves on different sides of many important issues. It is clear that Churchill\u2019s view on colonialism was diametrically opposed to Roosevelt\u2019s position and this strained their relationship as the end of the war drew near. It also seems from researching Teheran and Yalta that Roosevelt and Stalin had developed some areas of American and Soviet cooperation that may have endured a bit longer after the war if the President had lived. It was this collection of facts that allowed me to view the Big Three as participants in a three-way relationship that dynamically saw cooperation accompanied by a series of two on one debates that drove the strategic narrative of the war.\nCapturing the Big Three Dynamic\nThe design breakthrough that breathed life into this concept was the use of the conference as the central game activity. As in today, the staffs work the issues on a day-to-day basis, but periodically they need to get the \u2018big guys\u2019 to the table to finalize plans and priorities. The conference mechanic began as just a piece of an earlier attempt at this topic with a card trick mechanic within a larger \u2018wargame\u2019.\nWhat you hold in your hands is actually the second version of \nthis design. This happens to me from time to time, such as when I did We The People  where my first attempt while functional did \nnot accomplish the narrative that I wanted to experience. Only the conference mechanic carried over into this version where it became the center of the design with the military portion relegated to determining the wars progress based on the priorities chosen by the players.\nThe big mechanic breakthrough for this version was to introduce \nthe idea of a conference table with issues being metaphorically advanced and debated as each side tried to have their point of view drive the war. The early trick mechanic became the staff cards that captured the feel of the personalities who shaped the big picture.\nBased on my extensive reading it appeared that each conference \nwas driven by the presence of the leader and a small number of key advisors (see photo in the illustrated example of play). It also appeared that each side went into conference with advantages gained from preliminary staff work that translated into tangible decision leverage at the conference. This led to the conference sequence of play where your first card play represented your pre-conference staff work that set the tone for the meeting. This issue nomination procedure allows you to set the agenda based on your evolving strategy as informed by the state of Axis resistance. \nWhile I always had historical conference cards my hardcore \ntesters, such as the 1\nst Minnesota group, motivated me to cre-\nate more uncertainty in the conference card deck. So you will find that the A versions in the conference deck are most closely aligned to actual events whereas the B and C versions introduce some alternate history conditions.\nWho\u2019s Who in the Zoo\nOne of the fun things about this design was the opportunity to put the important but often overlooked personages who made a difference into the game. While most World War II games focus on the great military leaders, when was the last time that you had the US Secretary of the Treasury take center stage? For my English friends, I know that the British staff cards in the game were not knighted until after the war, but I wanted people to ap-preciate that they were significant because they were eventually given the title. Many of the staff personages held multiple posts during the war, some died, some were promoted, some were out of office at the war\u2019s close, so I chose to freeze them with the position that they held at significant times during the war.\nOne thing that was illustrated by my research is senior people \ngained their experience over the course of a long and prestigious career. Said another way, they are not a young crowd. The number of ailments and infirmities that many of them suffered during the war needed to be worked into this design. You will have some key members of your team die of natural causes or in the case of the Soviets a firing squad.\nOf course the biggest loss will be the death of Roosevelt. One \nof the insights that I gained from this design is how courageous and tough FDR was to travel to Yalta when it was clear his health was failing.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4816, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beb66cf9-0b30-4f8b-9eff-3244d2a7c643": {"__data__": {"id_": "beb66cf9-0b30-4f8b-9eff-3244d2a7c643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "352dfeb0-652e-4d7f-946e-0a6f19d06a46", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "2b961e8b5dd0ce467ac223925f40848d4375aa36901e2084d3d6d4445581dad4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "717c1be7-2e68-4b3a-ae12-8153b33b70c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "94b9b7a2aa09c72c9211bd3bfaa382543b84fcc03bfd2dacd53e6d4f7b5fd40b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74d22ebc-a200-4ade-9212-4826cb3c09c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef23095adefb8ee281196fba252b0e1daecb26d8d953a7eedca932f13446c320", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Many of the staff personages held multiple posts during the war, some died, some were promoted, some were out of office at the war\u2019s close, so I chose to freeze them with the position that they held at significant times during the war.\nOne thing that was illustrated by my research is senior people \ngained their experience over the course of a long and prestigious career.

One \nof the insights that I gained from this design is how courageous and tough FDR was to travel to Yalta when it was clear his health was failing. Just compare the Big Three photo from Tehran and Yalta to see how much he had deteriorated over the course of the war. That kind of bravery is not always obvious, but his last trip to Yalta stands as a testament to his fortitude. He died two months after Yalta.\nNational Asymmetries\nOne thing that I like to build into any game is the asymmetric strengths and weaknesses of the various protagonists. The Brit-ish staff is well organized and good at driving the war through leadership, production, and military strategy. Churchill is the key big picture member of the team with his advantages in working the Global issue. The UK national characteristic gives them a small but significant advantage in shaping the agenda for a given conference.\nThe Americans are a balanced team capable of tackling any issue. \nRoosevelt is the obvious foil to Churchill\u2019s big picture capability, so FDR and Churchill often cancel each other out when disagree -\nments arise. The US arsenal of democracy characteristic puts Roosevelt in the position of arbiter over tight calls. You need to pay attention to this ability as maneuvering situations into ties allows you to be more efficient. The other key element for the Americans is they are the primary driver of Pacific strategy. While the British and the Soviets for the most part place a low priority on the Pacific it is up to Roosevelt to defeat Japan. Failure to pay attention to the Japanese will cost the Americans the game, so while they have more production than anyone else you will often find yourself short of production, especially after the Soviets and the British capture your production issues.", "start_char_idx": 3958, "end_char_idx": 6459, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74d22ebc-a200-4ade-9212-4826cb3c09c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "74d22ebc-a200-4ade-9212-4826cb3c09c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ba0b7061-8f36-446c-8906-856977f2f5e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "6f9a3594655b5075bae65749e7a0ed8496c6e9da2be1d24021e0054a27c47db7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "beb66cf9-0b30-4f8b-9eff-3244d2a7c643", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "74370a81c932aa7b4d0c285cacb52d5a7a1d73e58c719d6734a809b6575a62ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "54aae9cb-1f50-479d-a53b-765ba61745ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9b666a859b583c3c4e3be753019e955f31fb36e70702f77ae81e300b758e0bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Churchill Rules34\n\u00a9 2015 GMT Games, LLC\nLastly we have the Soviets who are dominated by a paranoid \ndictator. The Soviet staff is primarily a military staff. If Stalin is efficient in how he handles a conference his staff cards will generate bonus offensive support freeing up production to pay for political-military issues. Stalin\u2019s big advantage is in atomic espionage where he cannot be debated. His historical success in this area was an unwanted surprise after the war. The US in particular needs to remember that when the A-Bomb Research issue is in the center of the table if you blink a quick Stalin play will take the issue off the table abstractly capturing their suc-cessful penetration of the Manhattan project.\nChanneling the history\nOne of the most difficult things to do is how to get gamers to play under a set of conditions that is antithetical to how they usually behave. In our world, he who gets the most points wins. Churchill is trying to capture a different narrative. This is a game of cooperation to win the war, while you compete to gain advantage in the peace that follows. As I have been conducting playtests over the last two years I have seen a range of gamer behaviors that need to be accommodated to channel players into a more subtle situation. \nAt different times during the war over important issues, such as \ncolonialism, collective security, and spheres of influence serious disagreements and downright prevarication occurred. At least for the time being these disagreements were tempered by the reality that the war was not yet won. Allied insistence on unconditional surrender severely limited Nazi Germany\u2019s and Imperial Japan\u2019s diplomatic options. These realities meant this was a death match of global proportions and the Allies needed each other to see the task through to the end. Historically none of the Big Three could overtly work against the interests of the others. If that had oc-curred, World War II might have had a very different end game.\nTo keep players within the lines of the historical narrative I have \ncreated three distinct victory conditions. The historical condition is the Allies win and the level of cooperation has led to a close score (15 points or less) between first and third place. To win historically you have to play cooperatively with the other players by controlling the pace of the game to win by a small margin. The number 15 was used based on playtest statistics whereby in the majority of games where the Axis surrendered the score differential was 15 or less. \nIn some playtest games one player decided to let the other two \ncarry the burden of the war, while they played for a high score. To solve this issue I fell back on my policy background. In the real world two classic strategies to handle a strong opponent is to either bandwagon or balance. Band-wagoning sees weak powers align themselves with the strong power. The other alternative is for powers to create an alliance to balance against the dominant power. My view is if one power mistimed advancing their post war strategy and emerged too quickly as a major threat the other two powers would balance into a new coalition with the leader of the coalition gaining post war leverage. Could England have aligned with the Soviets against the Americans? Not in an overt military manner, but as Churchill\u2019s spheres of influence agree-ment with Stalin (Churchill\u2019s naughty document) showed, his global view had elements that were antithetical to Roosevelt\u2019s vision. Similarly Churchill often found himself on the outs with Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta as it was clear that the British em-pires sun was setting leaving the impression that the Americans and Soviets would shape the meaningful elements of the peace. From a game point of view, if you come out swinging and out-score your opponents, the leader of the new coalition, the side in second place, may win the game. So far it has been a very rare event, because forewarned is forearmed.\nThe hardest situation to deal with is when the player in last place \nworks against their Allies interests. I can see a situation where if one of the Allies found themselves on the outs they might be willing to make a separate peace with an Axis power to level the post war playing field. In this situation the Axis do not suc-cumb to unconditional surrender and in the ensuing chaos a new global security framework emerges. The winner determined by the side with the highest score that was best positioned to handle uncertainty. If the score is close the player in last place might gain advantage, but more importantly prevents the player in last from acting as a kingmaker.

What I like about this option is it leaves the door open for the surprise come from behind Machiavellian victory.\nScenarios\nI have created three distinct scenarios that I think are worth discussing as I close these notes out. It covers the end of the war using the last three conferences. Although labeled a training scenario it can be very competitive with no room for error. Give it a try if your time window for a game is short.\nThe heart of the game is the tournament scenario. If covers \nthe war from conference six (London) to ten (Potsdam). Every time I play this one I feel like there just isn\u2019t enough time to get everything done. This is a 2-3 hour affair that almost always delivers a tight competitive game. Most of the play testing was done using this scenario. Most people will spend most of their time with this one and it is the one I will use in any future tour -\nnaments, hence its title.\nIf you want to experience the entire spectrum of situations, \nthe campaign game is the place for you. This is a potentially a 10 conference game, although I often find that the war ends in seven or eight. The reason for the shorter wars is it takes some experience with the system to control the pace of the war to your advantage. If you find yourself behind in the scoring you should slow the game down to give yourself the maximum amount of time to close on the leader. One of the inputs I got from some of the playtesters is they did not like being able to know the exact score.

My first solo design was the Peloponnesian War circa 1991. While there have been many other solo systems out there my most recent experience was designing the original version of the US \u2019Bot for Fire in the Lake followed by a variant for the second edition for Empire of the Sun. The three \u2019Bots in this game are kissing cousins of the COIN \u2019Bots, so they will be familiar to many. They worked almost from the first draft and other than a bit of tweaking they have served me well. \nMy philosophy around \u2019Bots is they are there to fill in, but with \ntheir logic and their cards visible you should prevail, but hope-fully after a enjoyable gaming experience. That said, Churchill  \nis best played with at least one other human, preferably two.\nI now find myself at the end of another design journey. I must \nsay that this one has been one of the best in my career. I plan on creating a series of games using the conference mechanic with the next up Pnyx: The Peloponnesian War where you will get to \nbe Pericles and the other statesmen of that period living through the original Greek tragedy.\nAnon,\nMark Herman\nNYC, February 2015", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3244, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abc6c99f-8366-4cbd-a285-697740b99a8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "abc6c99f-8366-4cbd-a285-697740b99a8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f22a34a-310d-4857-9210-02d6c028e756", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "31c27fbf1bafddbf0a0ba33a385911a192963dfdcc2c22895570491178cf0f46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef055da4-d91f-4268-82e7-dfe500632747", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\CHURCHILLRules-Final.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2051633, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "acaf13a0bd5e125fe961de65b965961a7413d671a8f573f2f50dcb68306b3a3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1b05a2a-1f0b-41f8-8656-8e45f74b8701", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19efa2822e0e8d4ea942b5caed9bfaffa80ccc88f84744a08f7782385e2916c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Churchill Rules36\nGMT Games, LLC\nP .O.

You can accumulate \ncoins during the game, but you will earn most of them during \nend-game scoring in the following three categories:\n Every star token placed\n Every territory controlled\n Every 2 resources controlled\nThe amount of coins you earn depends on your level on the \nPopularity Track. The higher your popularity, the more coins \nyou will earn. You can also get a few bonus coins based on \nwhere you built structures.DESIGNED BY JAMEY STEGMAIER\nART AND WORLDBUILDING BY JAKUB ROZALSKI1-5 PLAYERS \u2022 115 MINUTES\nScythe is a board game set in an alternate-history 1920s.  \nIt is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor.\nBACKSTORY\nThe ashes from the first Great War still darken the snow in 1920s Europa. The capitalistic city-state known simply as \u201cThe Factory,\u201d \nwhich fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries. \nWith characters from five factions converging onto a small but highly desired swath of land, who will gain fame and \nfortune by establishing their empire as the leader of Eastern Europa?\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\nIn Scythe, each player represents a character attempting to \nmake their faction the richest and most powerful in Eastern \nEuropa. Players explore and conquer territory, enlist new \nrecruits, produce resources and workers, build structures, \nand deploy monstrous mechs. A game of Scythe typically \nbegins with players building up their infrastructure, \nexploring the world, then engaging each other in combat. \nThe game progresses as players place stars (achievements) \non the board, and it ends when a player places their 6th star \non the Triumph Track. You can earn a star for accomplishing \nany of the following:\n Complete all 6 upgrades\n Deploy all 4 mechs\n Build all 4 structures\n Enlist all 4 recruits\n  Have all 8 workers on  \nthe board\n  Reveal 1 completed \nobjective card\n Win combat (up to 2 times)\n Have 18 popularity\n Have 16 power\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   1ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   1 4/3/22   7:57 PM4/3/22   7:57 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2210, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb02b928-f663-48b4-82ce-3d676ed64da3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb02b928-f663-48b4-82ce-3d676ed64da3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eddfd7a3-5e5b-44ef-a337-afb2a16db975", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "36c1affb0569c6b98461d1a13a1d898d743ecd4a2cc5d8adcdb44505584b4783", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1b05a2a-1f0b-41f8-8656-8e45f74b8701", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "cf64349f6fa6e9fd268408cd7ed90cf19a2c8a04c4a1cc9ccb864d5fe4d13773", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "44c6ffda-3f7b-4f02-bb08-c3e1d136ead1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ee1bef7ca2d27a45f8c60f58eb76a8f5af5f6a58cecf3260cc26f9fb1b17427", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE\nGAME BOARD\n1.

You may take the \ntop and/or bottom action (in that order). You mus\nt choose a different section of your Player Mat from your previous turn.\nTRIUMPH TRACK\nPlace a star on the Triumph Track as soon as you complete one of the requirements. Each achievement ma\ny only be awarded once (note: there are two combat victory achievements). Once\n you place a star, it cannot be lost. When a player places a sixth \nstar, the game immediately ends.END GAME SCORING\nGain coins for each star on the Triumph Track, each te\nrritory controlled, and every two resources\n.

base is not a territory, so by default you cannot move units, build \nstructures, or deploy mechs onto any home base, including your own.\nEXPANSION FACTIONS:  There are two home bases on the game board without corresponding \npieces. These are placeholders for expansion factions. \nCONTROL\nYou control a territory if you have at least one unit there (a character, worker, or mech) OR \nif you have a structure there with no enemy characters, workers, or mechs. Only one player \nat a time can control a territory.\nRESOURCES\nResource tokens (wood, food, metal, and oil) remain on the board once produced. You may only spend resources from \nterritories you currently control.\nSPEND RESOURCES FROM ANY TERRITORIES YOU CONTROL:  You can spend resources on territories you control for actions related to \nterritories anywhere on the board. For example, you can spend 3 metal tokens you control on one or more territories to \ndeploy a mech on the same or a different territory (if you have a worker on that territory).\nSUPPLY: When you spend a resource, remove it from the board and place it in the general supply at the side of the board. \nWhen you produce or trade for a resource (details in the  Top-Row Actions  section, pages 12-13), move it from the supply \nto the territory where it was produced. There are no limits to the number of resource tokens in the game\u2014use multiplier \ntokens as needed.\nWORKERS AREN\u2019T RESOURCES.  Resources are wood, food, metal, and oil. Workers are not resources.TERRITORY\nA territory is a hex on the \nboard labeled with one of \nthe following terrain types:\nFARM FOREST\nPRIMARY TERRAIN TYPESLAKE MOUNTAIN TUNDRA VILLAGE FACTORY\nEXAMPLE OF RESOURCE CONTROL: In this image, the Nordic \nfaction controls each of the territories on which \nit has one of its units or structures (blue pieces, \nincluding the character miniature with the blue \nbase). It can spend any of the resources on those \nterritories. It cannot spend the metal tokens on the \nterritory on the bottom left because it does not have a \nunit or structure there.\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   4ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   4 4/3/22   7:58 PM4/3/22   7:58 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2302, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e3b6482-305f-426f-9430-08d37a711d77": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e3b6482-305f-426f-9430-08d37a711d77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2723154-46b5-4b93-801b-dfc61aa4e312", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "15dab5e631d74a1c0040e7bf7c249ef70650a068e02c4014598501378a81d917", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26817a49-8fc5-4475-9b81-27627ae8749f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "1a2c310e422fed44d70aaacb30e732c056038d30f74fc28c727609cc0eca8878", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "202534ec-9be0-4353-81ee-5f6e645c38a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0a91dd29195dbeccf99d12187cb1e3e3ab53114ccb4ee28bf46c7ac785eb482", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5Each type of unit also has some unique traits that aren\u2019t \nshared by the other unit types. These concepts will be \nexplained in detail later in the rules. \nPLASTIC WOOD\nA visual cue in Scythe is that tokens that take part in combat are made out of plastic \n(characters and mechs). All other tokens are made out of wood to show that they do not \ntake part in combat (workers, resources, and structures).Characters can engage \nin combat, can have \nencounters, and (once per \ngame) gain a Factory card \nif they end their movement \non the Factory. You are \nrepresented on the board by \nyour character. You have been \nsent on a mission by your \nfaction \u2019s leader to claim the \nuncharted lands surrounding \nthe defunct Factory.Mechs  can engage in \ncombat and , when moving, \ncan transport any number \nof workers. Mechs cannot \ntransport your character.  \nMechs are built for war (and \nfor discouraging other factions \nfrom engaging in war with \nthem), and they\u2019re big enough \nthat they can carry workers \nwithin their iron shells.Workers  can produce \nresources and more \nworkers, deploy mechs, and \nbuild structures. These are \nthe people of the land who \nhave joined your cause to \nbuild an empire for you.Each of the three unit types in the game\u2014characters, \nmechs, and workers\u2014share two key similarities:\n  They can move around the board (not over rivers or onto \nlakes, by default).\n  They can transport any number of resource tokens.TYPES OF UNITS\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   5ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   5 4/3/22   7:58 PM4/3/22   7:58 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1541, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "202534ec-9be0-4353-81ee-5f6e645c38a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "202534ec-9be0-4353-81ee-5f6e645c38a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fb359ef-30ca-49d2-ad83-41d4fd9ac36b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "472b24856779ed2a7e3a5c447dc8ee489b6c7bb9ebb97f48f9c1b9dd7d0c774b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e3b6482-305f-426f-9430-08d37a711d77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "15dab5e631d74a1c0040e7bf7c249ef70650a068e02c4014598501378a81d917", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a58bf9c-7811-4d53-ae0e-27d5a47b0bfc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3f8f6ff8eaec6b8356bc37f0545244c0ca57f44c0e5fe675b2444c3f7925deb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "6BOARD SETUPSETUP\nOBJECTIVE CARDS (BEIGE): Shuffle \nthe objective cards and put \nthem on the board.ENCOUNTER CARDS (GREEN) : \nShuffle the encounter \ncards and put them on \nthe board.COMBAT CARDS (YELLOW):  Shuffle \nthe combat cards and put \nthem on the board.

Also, you may \ncomplete an objective card during your turn (see Objective  \nsection, page 26).\nThe costs (red boxes) and benefits (green boxes) on your \nPlayer Mat are shown by the number of empty spaces before  \nthe action is taken.

The Player Mat visuals \nand the default costs and benefits explained in this section are based on the starting position of each Player Mat.\nMOVE\nDo one of the following (\u201c/\u201d means \n\u201cor\u201d):\nMOVE:  Move up to 2 different  units \nyou control (character, worker, or \nmech) from one territory (or home \nbase) to one adjacent territory. \nMove one, then move the other. \nGAIN COIN(S):  Gain $1.\nHere are some important notes about how movement works:\nRESOURCES AND WORKERS: Units may pick up and drop off any \nnumber of resource tokens during a Move action. \n  MECHS: In addition to resources, your mechs can pick up \nand drop off any number of your workers during a Move \naction. If they do, this does not count as movement for \nthe workers, just the mech. So you could transport some \nworkers on a mech, and then one of those workers could \nmove on its own. You could also use part of your Move \naction to move a worker onto a territory with a mech, \nthen move the mech while carrying the worker.\nRIVERS AND LAKES: By default, units may not move across rivers \nor onto lakes. This rule is broken by some mech abilities \n(see Mech abilities for Polania and Nordic, pages 16-17).\n  RIVER:  A river is a body of water on the border between two \nland territories.\n  LAKE:  A lake is a body of water comprised of an entire \nterritory hex. It extends from the hex to any adjacent \nshoreline. Thus, in the example shown here, if a player \nhas a special lake-movement ability, they could move \nfrom any of the surrounding territories onto the lake. \nTUNNELS: For the purposes of the Move action for any unit, all \nterritories with the tunnel icon (\n ) are considered to be \nadjacent to each other.RIVER\nLAKETUNNELMOVING INTO OPPONENT-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES: \n CONTROLLED BY WORKERS\n \u00bb  If your character or mech  move into a territory \ncontrolled by an opponent\u2019s workers (and no other \nunits), its movement ends (even if you have a mech \nability that would allow it to move further). Each of \nthe opponent\u2019s workers on that territory immediately \nretreats to their faction\u2019s home base, leaving behind \nany resource tokens. You lose 1 popularity for each of \ntheir workers you forced to retreat\u2014they\u2019re not happy \nwith you for forcing them off their land (in the case \nthat you cannot reduce your popularity any further, the \nworkers are still forced to retreat). \n \u00bb  Your workers  cannot move by themselves into \nterritories controlled by opponent workers.\n  CONTROLLED BY A STRUCTURE\n \u00bb  Any unit can move into a territory controlled only by \na structure. The player who controls the unit now also \ncontrols the territory. \n CONTROLLED BY CHARACTER AND/OR MECHS\n \u00bb  If your character or mech  move into a territory \ncontrolled by an opponent\u2019s character and/or mechs, \nits movement ends (even if you have a mech ability \nthat would allow it to move further).

For example, trading for a desired resource \nis sometimes preferable to moving a worker to a territory that provides that resource.

The Player Mat visuals and \nthe default costs and benefits explained in this section are based on the starting position of each Player Mat.\nOVERLAPPING TURNS:  Usually when a player starts to take the \nbottom-row action (which isn\u2019t interactive but may take a few \nseconds to figure out), the next player can start to take their \nturn.\nCOINS:  Most of the bottom actions give you at least one coin \nwhen you pay to take that action. We recommend that players \ntake the coins before implementing the main focus of the \naction so they don\u2019t forget to gain those coins. A player may \nchoose not to take the coins (e.g., if coins interfere with their \nobjective).COMPLETING ACTIONS: Eventually you may \u201ccomplete\u201d a bottom-\nrow action (e.g., with the Upgrade action, at some point you \nmay have nothing more to upgrade). After that point you may \ncontinue to pay the cost of the action to gain the coins (and \nthe recruit bonus, if applicable).\nRECRUITS:  Each of the bottom actions has a Recruit Ongoing \nBonus (green circle). If it is exposed, it rewards a player when \nthey or adjacent opponents take this action. See the Enlist \nsection for details (page 20).BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS\nUPGRADE  \nUpgrading improves the efficiency of the infrastructure in \nyour growing empire.

Red boxes with solid black \nborders are off limits for upgrades. \nEXAMPLE:  You decide that you want to be able to \nProduce on 3 territories instead of 2 (ignore the Mill \nfor this example), and you want to decrease the cost \nof enlisting a recruit by 1 food. By taking the Upgrade \naction, in addition to paying the oil cost and gaining \nthe coin benefit, pick up any technology cube from a \ngreen box (in this case, the Produce action benefit) \nand move it to any red box with bracketed borders \n(in this case, the Enlist action cost).\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   14ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   14 4/3/22   7:58 PM4/3/22   7:58 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2188, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1042a82f-bbc5-403a-a1ad-2cc21ed98590": {"__data__": {"id_": "1042a82f-bbc5-403a-a1ad-2cc21ed98590", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c967e5e6-2bfc-46dc-9469-38b3e12598ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "e7243abb4ace3c3a9ef06efe4d8c6c638f7a291190c618539fc7ad2df46c95ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "145cf6fa-2eee-45ce-9974-796ddfde339a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "524210f0ca92424c525ebdd5d4a1dc4d3b8b94622ad550e1967f3467a998d91d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bf39d9d-b9b5-4337-b254-166b0031db16", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6dc2a442552813a8f38e2852d5353dba989222c8c44c8897f9f6e33b7f1e9cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "15DEPLOY\nYou can deploy mechs (miniatures) to protect your workers, \nexpand your empire, and add new abilities to your character \nand other mechs.

If Saxony has \navailable stars, after winning combat, they must  place the star.FACTION ABILITIES\nDESIGNER\u2019S NOTE:  One of the subtle benefits of some of these faction abilities is that they \nhelp to teach and remind players of the global rules of Scythe...by breaking those rules. \nFor example, when you read that the Rusviet faction can choose the same section of their \nPlayer Mat on subsequent turns, you also learn that under normal circumstances, you \ncan \u2019t choose the same section twice in a row. In a game with lots of rules to remember, I \nfound that these subtle reminders really help.\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   21ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   21 4/3/22   7:59 PM4/3/22   7:59 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2834, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8c11593-2193-4086-8a08-8ed083d0ac1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8c11593-2193-4086-8a08-8ed083d0ac1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f107fe78-0283-463e-9d31-8ca79796404a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "0c08adbb44719eb5f3e6bd9dc316e7121c4b264742b8806677b51825ceac1084", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "91458fb5-db53-4389-8dea-518c0a7a3aa6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "4214e9f258cf765d3e2bcc842a16a3ef4650af5287ac50d37e93f98f5d6ed39a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c7e1727-7b00-4dde-ad73-cfda94f6e8bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72acf51b1a9568bcda0d031fdca66e3eb0236b491117a141d7d6681aa933aa98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "22Combat may happen at the end of a player\u2019s Move action (after all units have moved but \nbefore the player takes a bottom-row action). If that player\u2019s character and/or mechs share \na territory with an opponent\u2019s character and/or mechs, combat occurs. It\u2019s possible for this \nto happen on multiple territories; in that case, the active player (the attacker) chooses the \norder in which these combats occur.\nCombat happens only between the two players whose units share a territory, either of \nwhom can gain a star for winning the combat. Other players may try to influence the \ncombating players by bribing them with coins (see \nAlliances and Bribes , page 26).\nNO REQUIREMENTS: You may initiate combat even if you have 0 \npower and/or 0 popularity.\nATTACKER ADVANTAGE: If the attacking player has a mech ability \nthat impacts combat, they use that ability first, followed by \nthe defending player. Also, if combat results in a tie, the \nattacking player wins.\nSELECT POWER\nSimultaneously and secretly select a number on your Power \nDial (align the number with the icon at the top right). \nThat is the amount of power you will spend, so you cannot \nchoose a number higher than the amount of power you \ncurrently have on the Power Track. The track goes up to 16 \nbut you can only spend up to 7 power on your Power Dial.\nADD COMBAT CARD(S) (OPTIONAL):  By default, for each of your units \ninvolved in the current combat (character and/or mechs), \nyou may tuck 1 combat card from your hand behind the \nPower Dial. You may do this even if you select 0 power on  \nyour Power Dial.\nThe number of combat cards you have in hand is public  \ninformation, but during combat you may conceal whether  \nor not you\u2019ve used any of those cards.

However, if you look at all of the illustrations, you \u2019ll notice \nthat very few of the mechs are actually fighting. In that way, Scythe is \njust as much about the threat of combat as it is actual combat. If your \nneighbor has built up a big pool of power and combat cards, you \u2019re less \nlikely to attack them. Similarly, you might position workers on key \nterritories to dissuade more aggressive players from attacking you there \ndue to the loss of popularity if they win. It is this tension that exemplifies \nthe core theme of Scythe: the intersection of farming and war.POWER DIAL ASSEMBLY  \nAssemble your \npower dial by \nplacing the \nenclosed plastic \nrivets through the \npunched out holes.\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   22ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   22 4/3/22   7:59 PM4/3/22   7:59 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2756, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c7e1727-7b00-4dde-ad73-cfda94f6e8bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c7e1727-7b00-4dde-ad73-cfda94f6e8bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb8c4e53-2efb-4f0b-bb03-46fad9ab7e4a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "a38fd4c3463f2abece3174cdf8938f179e9aab3819b913c441753f2464ac344a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8c11593-2193-4086-8a08-8ed083d0ac1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "0c08adbb44719eb5f3e6bd9dc316e7121c4b264742b8806677b51825ceac1084", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "09d893a7-b96a-436b-a7c4-d5e233d6123c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5818c7628c5f744190116711bd37bb14000972ea5412869ae73f7bba54f75409", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "23REVEAL\nBoth players reveal their Power Dials and selected combat cards simultaneously. The value provided by any combat cards \nprovides an additional bonus to the power you spend from the Power Track as indicated on your Power Dial.\nThe player with the highest total power wins the combat (ties go to the attacking player). Both players then pay the amount \nof power they selected on their Power Dials, and they discard any combat cards they used face-up (you don\u2019t adjust the \nPower Track for combat cards\u2014they\u2019re just a temporary boost).\nWINNER:  The winner gains (or maintains) control of the \nterritory and all resource tokens on it. The winner also \nplaces 1 star token in the combat space of the Triumph \nTrack (see Placing Stars , page 27) if they haven\u2019t already \nplaced 2 stars for combat victories. If the winner was the \nattacker, they lose 1 popularity for each worker they forced \nto retreat by initiating and winning combat. Also, if there \nwas an encounter token on the territory and the winner has \na character there, they now perform the encounter.\nLOSER: The loser must retreat all of their units\u2014mechs, \ncharacters, and workers\u2014from the combat territory to their \nhome base (pick up those units and put them down on \ntheir home base). All resources those units were carrying \nremain on the territory and are now under the control of \nthe winner. If the loser revealed at least 1 power on the \ndial or through combat cards, they gain 1 combat card as \nthey retreat. \nLIMITED STARS AND GAME END:  Each player can gain a maximum \nof 2 stars for winning combat (with the exception of the \nSaxon player, who can gain unlimited combat victory stars), \nbut they may still engage in future combats after they\u2019ve \nachieved those 2 stars. If your 6th star is placed but you still \nhave a combat remaining on your turn, the game ends and \nany units you moved to initiate that combat will move back \nto the territory from whence they came.\nBATTLE IN A LAKE:  Lake battles can happen between factions \nlike Polania and Nordic that have activated lake-related \nmech abilities. If a mech transporting workers is attacked \nwhile on a lake and the attacker wins combat, the attacking \nplayer loses 1 popularity for each of those workers (they are \nforced to retreat with the mech to their home base).EXAMPLE: John takes a Move action, first moving \nhis character onto an unoccupied farm, then \nmoving a mech carrying 2 workers onto a \nterritory controlled by Sandra. Sandra has her \ncharacter, a mech, a worker, and 3 food tokens \non that territory.\nJohn has 10 power and Sandra has 4 (this is \nshown on the Power Track on the board). John \nturns his dial to select 7 power. He has one \ncombat unit (the mech), so he can add 1 combat \ncard from his hand, but he chooses not to do so. \nSandra decides to spend 4 power on her Power \nDial. She has both her character and a mech on \nthe territory, so she can spend up to 2 combat \ncards if she wants to. She chooses to just play a \n3-power card and tucks it behind her Power Dial.\nWhen they\u2019ve both finalized their decisions, they \nreveal their Power Dials at the same time. Sandra \ngroans\u2014she tied John\u2019s total power (7 to 7), but \nattackers win ties! \nSo John takes over the territory and the 3 food, \nand Sandra\u2019s units retreat back to her home base. \nJohn loses 1 popularity because, as the attacker, \nhe forced 1 worker to retreat. John also places a \ncombat victory star on the board.\nSandra\u2019s only compensation is that she gets to \ndraw a combat card since she revealed at least 1 \npower on the dial or through combat cards.\nSTRATEGY TIP: Just because an opponent has a lot more power than you doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll \nwin in combat against you. They don\u2019t know how much power you will spend or the amount of power \nyour combat cards will add (combat cards aren\u2019t worth anything at the end of the game, so spend them \nearly and often). The puzzle of combat is outwitting your opponent, especially when they think they\u2019re \ngoing to win.\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   23ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   23 4/3/22   7:59 PM4/3/22   7:59 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4095, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09d893a7-b96a-436b-a7c4-d5e233d6123c": {"__data__": {"id_": "09d893a7-b96a-436b-a7c4-d5e233d6123c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e58ee5fe-c9a6-49f2-b156-8b031df4d29e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "c5bf63814faab3d0cda65e8fcf50efaeabd6d6381d214161ac665618e1a61ca9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c7e1727-7b00-4dde-ad73-cfda94f6e8bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "a38fd4c3463f2abece3174cdf8938f179e9aab3819b913c441753f2464ac344a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c3b649a-7bc4-44dd-a721-9b1c016aeb76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbbb7e238303748694aa0904195f6c76d8d17951e0359e477ad675f07f5a132b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "24As your character treks across Eastern Europa, they \nwill encounter a number of local people and situations. \nEach encounter will present you with three options to \ndetermine how you want to interact with the people.

It is a place of technological innovation \nand untapped power. Unlike most other territories, the Factory does not produce any \nresources. At the end of the game, the Factory is worth a total of 3 territories (instead of \njust 1) to the player who controls it.\nWhen your Move action is completely finished (after winning combat if necessary), if your \ncharacter is on the Factory for the first time this game, look through the Factory cards on \nthe board. You must choose one card and return the rest to the board.\nThe first player to look at those cards will see cards equal to the number of players +1; each \nsubsequent player to visit the Factory with their character will see one fewer card. It\u2019s good \nto get there first.\nFACTORY CARDS\nEach Factory card is the equivalent of a fifth section of your Player Mat (place it next to \nyour Player Mat). \nUSING FACTORY ACTIONS:  The Factory card is treated as any other section on your Player Mat. On \nyour turn, you may place your action token on the Factory card and take one or both actions \n(starting with the top-row action if you choose to take both).\n SEPARATE FROM PLAYER MAT BONUSES: Even if the Factory card action does something similar to \nanother action on your Player Mat, they\u2019re completely independent of one another. So you \nget neither Recruit Ongoing Bonuses, Structure bonuses, nor coins from similar actions \non your Player Mat.\nMOVE:  All Factory cards have a bottom-row Move action. It\u2019s a little different than a standard \nMove action, as it says, \u201cMove one unit up to two times within the same Move action.\u201d\n \n   CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RULES: All other rules for movement still apply, especially those \nthat say that the entire Move action ends if your character moves onto a territory \nwith an encounter token or a character/mech moves onto a territory occupied by an \nopponent\u2019s unit(s). \n \n   MINE:  If you have a Mine, you may move through the Mine with this Move action.\n \n   SPEED:  If you\u2019ve unlocked the Speed mech ability, one of your mechs or your character \nmay move up to 3 territories with this Move action.\nONE-CARD LIMIT:  You may have at most one Factory card (the one you choose the first time your \ncharacter goes to the Factory).\nPERMANENT SELECTION: Your selection is permanent\u2014you may not switch  your Factory card for \nanother card if your character ends a future Move action on the Factory.THE FACTORY\nSTRATEGY TIP: Don\u2019t underestimate the power of being able to move every turn. Without a \nFactory card, you can only move once every other turn, but once you get that card, you \nbecome much more nimble and responsive than players without that capability.EXAMPLE: This Factory \ncard allows you to \npay 1 popularity to \nEnlist a recruit OR \nperform an Upgrade \n(or skip the top-row \naction). Then you \nmay Move any one \nunit up to two times.\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   25ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   25 4/3/22   7:59 PM4/3/22   7:59 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2983, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97b87232-961a-4d3f-85a0-c578128a7204": {"__data__": {"id_": "97b87232-961a-4d3f-85a0-c578128a7204", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e2e7655-77d9-403a-a8ab-a76719d0fc18", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "7bc6433eeaca37b993c4fb94b4b85aabfcc98ba28d0240b82b5833d23bc3db02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c3b649a-7bc4-44dd-a721-9b1c016aeb76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3b1cf26a2f0645b060c1490c90455be87f9923205c5d822a421d52b44980f6c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2f2f6e0-a275-489a-a18e-edd83ac43251", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "db60ddd59b58cdf74883ac163fc05d33437de11e15cce672359ab4351c52eb1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "26Each player starts the game with 2 objective cards that are kept secret from \nthe other players. You may reveal a completed objective card during your own \nturn before or after you complete a top- or bottom-row action. If you do, \nplace 1 star token on the objective space of the Triumph Track and discard \nthe card along with your other objective to the bottom of the objective deck. \nYou can only achieve 1 objective star, unless you\u2019re the Saxon player, who can \nachieve up to 2 objective stars.\nYou may wait to reveal your completed objective if you wish, but you must \nmeet the entire objective requirements at the time you reveal it. OBJECTIVES\nALLIANCES AND BRIBESDESIGNER\u2019S NOTE:   It may seem a little odd that each player has 2 objective cards but \nmay only complete one of them. There are a few reasons for this. The first is that the \nalternative would be to have each player draw 2 cards at the beginning of the game and \nkeep 1. However, I prefer not to ask players to make decisions before the game begins, \nas it makes the game more welcoming to new players and gives experienced players \nmore freedom depending on how the game starts to play out. The second is that it gives \nplayers the flexibility to change strategies mid-game. Maybe you were pursuing one \nstrategy, but that strategy didn \u2019t end up working out. No problem\u2014you still have another \nobjective card to use.\nPlayers may make informal agreements (e.g., \u201cI won\u2019t attack you this turn if you don\u2019t \nattack me next turn\u201d). The only tangible items that may be exchanged are coins. In \ntournament play, coins may not be exchanged for deals or alliances.\nYou can\u2019t negotiate your way out of a combat that has already begun\u2014that is, if a player \nmoves their character and/or mechs onto a territory you control with your character and/\nor mechs, at the end of their Move action, the two of you must engage in combat (you can\u2019t \npay them off at that point, though you could try to influence the outcome). Agreements \nmade between players are not enforceable.\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   26ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   26 4/3/22   7:59 PM4/3/22   7:59 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2127, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2f2f6e0-a275-489a-a18e-edd83ac43251": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2f2f6e0-a275-489a-a18e-edd83ac43251", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac4234ff-99d1-4629-8a8c-2355bfe3565a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "5939d8d266edcee265823bfc370175807bff9d9e30f57f0ed8781cf0d3b84630", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "97b87232-961a-4d3f-85a0-c578128a7204", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "7bc6433eeaca37b993c4fb94b4b85aabfcc98ba28d0240b82b5833d23bc3db02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c4518f1-2fae-477a-9fdf-4a3cc5d2b7fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "99d393b49e5b90b1fa9626bcac3f87ff80d5459277107fc0557e5fb68a103d80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "27When you reach a pinnacle of empire building, your faction rewards you with a star.

However, it is possible for a player to \ninterrupt the game to calculate the final score for each \nplayer as they plan out their next few moves. That\u2019s not fun \nfor anyone. The Delay of Game variant says that if a player \ndelays the game (while the game is being played, not during \nend-game scoring) for more than 10 seconds by trying to \ncalculate the final score, they lose 2 popularity.GAME END AND SCORING\nDESIGNER\u2019S NOTE: Scythe incentivizes players to end the game \nif possible by making stars worth coins and denying \nadditional turns to opponents. This may result in some \nopponents having one fewer overall turns than the player \nwho placed their final star.  \nEND-GAME SCORING\nAccumulate your final fortune\u2014coins you had before \nthe game end was triggered plus end-game coins\u2014to \ndetermine the winner. You should have a mound of coins \nin front of you before announcing the total to the other \nplayers.\nTo determine how many coins you earn for each of \nthe three scoring categories, look at your level on the \nPopularity Track and pick up coins for that category (do this \non your own\u2014there is no need for a \u201cbanker\u201d).SAMPLE SCORING ROUND\nThe first time you play Scythe, we recommend that you run \na sample scoring round during the game so players have a \nfeel for the actual end-game scoring in advance. After any \nplayer places their first star, pause the game to let players \ncalculate their current score. This is just for the sake of \nexample\u2014this scoring does not actually happen until the \nend of the game.EDGE CASES\nIf the 6th star comes from taking a bottom-row action, gain \nthe primary benefit, the coins, and the Recruit Ongoing \nBenefit before placing the star.\nIf you have units (character, mechs, or workers) remaining \non a territory with an opponent\u2019s units (from a Move \naction), you must undo that portion of your Move action, \nreturning the unit(s) to the territory they moved from.\nIf you place a star for total popularity or total power as \na recruit bonus on an opponent\u2019s turn, that placement \nhappens after  the opponent takes the action (e.g., build \na structure) in clockwise order and only if that opponent \ndidn\u2019t place their 6th star by taking that action.\nScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   28ScytheRules_15th_r24.indd   28 4/3/22   7:59 PM4/3/22   7:59 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2894, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e450ed70-6bca-4a05-af99-e5c8a31be463": {"__data__": {"id_": "e450ed70-6bca-4a05-af99-e5c8a31be463", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5cd1c9b4-c811-4ebd-ba89-b3306abb0918", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "b9da10b3ee7fd1311cf6ce2b57f5b6f72dd1c73edc2a979e9a5ac30e37fc4b4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c4518f1-2fae-477a-9fdf-4a3cc5d2b7fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\ScytheRules_15th_r24.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 75836259, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "df4fe9b7ffb3f5d7750793fac455fc2d7b4f41920a119d7e1e827c85c2bc1916", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1b128b7-4de8-402e-813a-39f5a9f4d362", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e228e662e9040b0737cad0e9184c51fc69c1b4c32c7f9aa0b59b665c432144ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "29SCORING CATEGORIES\nCOINS IN HAND: The coins you accumulated during the game \ncount for end-game scoring.\nEVERY STAR TOKEN PLACED:  Gain coins for every star token you \nplaced during the game.\nEVERY TERRITORY CONTROLLED: Gain coins for every territory you \ncontrol (including lakes).

First pay the full cost of the \naction (all icons on exposed red boxes), then gain the benefit \n(exposed green boxes). If you select a bottom-row action, \nthe player to your left may start to take their turn while you \ndecide exactly which upgrade, mech, structure, or recruit you \nwill gain. Remember to take the coins from the bottom-row \nactions!\nMOVE ACTION:  You must move different units (not the same unit \nmultiple times). You may choose only to use part of the \nMove action if you only want to move one unit. A mech can \ntransport workers as part of its movement, then one of those \nworkers could also move.\nPRODUCE ACTION: Produce on 2 different territories. Each worker \non those territories may produce 1 resource token. So if you \nhave 3 workers on a forest and 2 workers on a farm, a Produce \naction generates 3 wood on the forest and 2 food on the farm.\nWORKERS: Workers are not resources, but they are produced on \nvillages just like resources are produced on other terrains. \nJust as with any Produce action, first pay the full cost on all \nexposed red boxes on the Produce action, then Produce the \nworker(s) by taking the meeple from your Player Mat (left \nto right). You may choose not to produce a worker, as it can \nincrease the cost of future Produce actions. Once produced, \nworkers may never return to your Player Mat.\nTRADE:  When taking the Trade action, choose any 2 resource \ntokens (either the same or different types) and place them on \na territory you control that contains a worker.\nBOLSTER:  Gain power on the Power Track or draw combat card(s). \nIf the combat card deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to \nform a new deck.\nBOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS:  You may continue to pay to take a bottom-row \naction for the coin(s) even after you\u2019ve achieved a star for the \naction. This will continue to trigger Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.\nUPGRADE: Pick up a technology cube from any green box on your \nPlayer Mat and place it on any red bracketed box on your \nPlayer Mat.\nMECHS: Only mechs may carry around workers (any number of \nworkers)\u2014not characters. Mech abilities apply to all mechs \nand your character. Each faction has a slightly different \nRiverwalk mech ability. If a mech has the Speed ability, it may \npick up and drop off workers/resources mid-movement.RIVERWALK: Each faction has a slightly different version of the \nRiverwalk ability, allowing them to move across rivers onto \ntwo specific terrain types.\nSTRUCTURES: Only a single structure may be present on each \nterritory. Structures can\u2019t be built on lakes.\nRECRUITS:  Gain a One-Time Recruit Bonus when taking the \nEnlist action. From then on, gain a Recruit Ongoing Bonus \nwhenever you or the player to your left or right take the \nbottom-row action corresponding to that bonus.\nCOMBAT:  Only characters and mechs participate in combat \n(moving a character or mech onto a territory containing \nan opponent\u2019s worker is not combat). Ties are won by the \nattacker. If the loser of combat revealed any power during the \ncombat (either on the Power Dial or via combat cards), they \ngain a combat card. Both the winner and loser must pay the \npower they selected on the Power Dial.\nRETREATING WORKERS (FORCED): You only lose popularity for forcing \nan opponent\u2019s worker to retreat on your turn. That is, if you \nare attacked by a mech with workers on it and you win the \ncombat, you do not lose 1 popularity for forcing each of those \nworkers to retreat. On your turn, you may force opponent \nworkers to retreat even if you don\u2019t have enough popularity.\nENCOUNTERS: Only characters may have encounters. To choose \nan option on the encounter card, you must be able to pay the \ncost (if any).

You can place buildings on any open plot in your capital city. Certain plots of land are \nimpassable ()\u2014you cannot build there, but they contribute toward the completion of districts, rows, and columns.\nTHERE ARE 2 CATEGORIES OF BUILDINGS:\nINCOME BUILDINGS (\n ): When you gain a farm, \nhouse, market, or armory, pick up the leftmost building of that \ntype from your income mat (revealing improvements to your \nincome) and place it in your capital city. \nLANDMARK BUILDINGS:  Landmarks show which civilization is the \nfirst to advance to a new tier on an advancement track or \nthe first to invent something (i.e., certain tech cards). Each \nlandmark is a specific building miniature with a unique shape \nthat you place in your capital city, aligned with the grid. There \nis exactly 1 of each landmark, so even if one of you finds a way \nto gain the same landmark again, you cannot. OTHER NOTES ABOUT BUILDINGS\n\u2022 When you complete a district  by filling all plots in one of the \nnine indicated 3x3 areas, immediately gain any 1 resource.\n\u2022 When scoring your capital city (\n ), gain 1 VP for every \ncompleted row and column.\n\u2022 You may gain and place buildings even if they extend outside \nof your city grid, as they may not always fit in an increasingly \ncrowded city.\nOTHER IMPORTANT NOTES\nCIVILIZATIONS: It is possible to gain additional civilizations (end of \nmilitary track, tech cards, etc). If you do, add them to the left of \nyour current civilization mat. If you run out of player tokens, use \nspare cubes. \nOVERLAPPING TURNS: If your turn isn\u2019t impacted by decisions being \nmade by the previous player, you may proceed to take your turn. \nThis is particularly important during a player\u2019s income turn after \nthey\u2019ve played their tapestry card.\nOPTIONAL VS MANDATORY REWARDS:  All bonuses in the game are \noptional. Benefits and landmarks are mandatory rewards.\nNEIGHBORS (\n or\n ): A few elements of the game have you \nconsider your neighbors. This refers to the players sitting to \nyour immediate left and right.ACHIEVEMENTS: There are 3 achievements on the board. When you \nearn each of them for the first time, place a player token on the \nhighest available VP space under that achievement. You cannot \nlose achievements or earn the same achievement twice.\nVICTORY POINT TRACK: If you exceed 100 VP , place your VP token \non the 100 space, and place a second player token at 0. If you \nexceed 200 VP , shift the token over (and so on for 300 and 400).\nVARIABLE LENGTH:  While each player will take the same number of \nincome turns (5), the number of advance turns will vary. \nAI SINGULARITY:  This technology track benefit may result in \nyou having multiple player tokens on the same track. Either \nis eligible for advance turns. When considering the relative \nposition on a track, only look at your most advanced token.\nEND GAME\nThe game ends at different times for each player. Your game \nends when you finish your final (5th) income turn. Gain benefits \nfrom your civilization, 1 upgrade, and victory points as shown \non your income mat, but you cannot play a tapestry card \n(including traps) or gain income. If other players still have turns \nafter your game has ended, you may still gain victory points \nfrom passive civilization abilities, but you cannot gain anything \nelse.When all players have taken their final income turns, the \nwinner is the player with the most victory points.\nIn case of a tie, the player with the most total resources \nremaining is the winner. Otherwise, players share the victory.  \nA great final score is 300 VP .\nYou may log the win at stonemaiergames.com/games/tapestry. \nIf any cultures emerge as significantly overpowered, this is \nwhere we will suggest a starting VP handicap.This capital city has 3 complete rows and columns, so each time \nyou score it, you will gain 3 VP .\nYou cannot earn the same achievement twice.

Kennedy, Inaugural Speech, January 1961 \nIn \u0018945, unlikely allies slew the Nazi beast, while humanity\u2019s \nmost devastating weapons forced the proud Japanese Empire to \nits knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great \npowers, now stood only two. The world had scant time to sigh \nrelief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic conflicts \nof the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged primarily \nnot by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists \nand intellectuals, artists and traitors.\nTwilight Struggle  is a two-player game simulating the forty-five-\nyear dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare \nbetween the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world \nis the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world \nsafe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins \namidst the ruins of Europe as the two new \u2018superpowers\u2019 struggle \nover the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in \u0018989, \nwhen only the United States remained standing.\nTwilight Struggle  inherits its fundamental systems from the card-\ndriven classics We the People  and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage.  \nIt is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. \nEvent cards cover a vast array of historical happenings, from \nthe Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the \nU.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other \nsuch incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear \nannihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race \nas well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of nuclear war \nending the game.\nThese rules are organized into numbered sections, with some sections further subdivided into subsections (for example, 2.\u0018 \nand 2.2). In a number of places in the rules, you will see refer -\nences made to rules sections and subsections that are related to \nthe one you are reading.\nAdditionally, terms that have specialized meaning within these \nrules, such as \u2018Influence\u2019 or \u2018Battleground\u2019, are consistently capi -\ntalized to allude to their specialized context within the rules.2.0 COMPONENTS\nA complete game of Twilight Struggle  includes the following:\n\u2022 One 22\u201d by 34\u201d Map Board\n\u2022 Two sheets of markers\n\u2022 One Rules Booklet\n\u2022 Two Player Aid Cards\n\u2022 \u0018\u00180 Cards \u2022 Two 6-sided dice\n2.1 THE GAME MAP\n\u201cFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron \ncurtain has descended across the continent.\u201d\n\u2014Winston Churchill\n2.1.1 The map is divided into six Regions: Europe, Asia, Central \nAmerica, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. A region \nis a group of geopolitically connected nations, normally in close \ngeographic proximity. Europe is divided into two sub-regions, \nEastern Europe and Western Europe. Two historically neutral \ncountries (Austria and Finland) are categorized as being in \nboth Eastern and Western Europe. \nAsia also contains a sub-region, \nSoutheast Asia. The country spaces \nthat comprise a region share a map \ncolor. Sub-regions have shades of the \nsame color. \nDESIGN NOTE: Although not exactly geographically correct, \nthe Middle East includes Libya and Egypt for political purposes, \nwhile Canada and Turkey are included in the Europe Region.\n2.1.2  Any event, rule, action, or card that refers to \u2018Europe\u2019 or \n\u2018Asia\u2019 includes the associated sub-regions. \n2.1.3  Each space on the map represents a country or bloc of \ncountries (hereafter simply called a country). Each country has \na Stability Number representing the country\u2019s overall stability, \nindependence and power.\n2.1.4 Battleground States. While most states have their names \non white, Battleground countries operate the same way as normal spaces but have special rules for scoring (see \u00180.\u0018) and coup \nattempts (6.3).

Brown lines represent connections \nwithin a region. Red dashed lines represent connections between \ncountries in different regions. The black lines indicate connec -\ntions between countries and superpowers. A country is considered \nadjacent to all other countries to which it is connected.\nDESIGN NOTE: Being adjacent is not entirely a reflection of \ngeography. Several countries that share physical boundaries do \nnot have connections in the game.

Place the Defcon marker on the 5 space of the DEFCON \nTrack. Finally, place the VP marker on the Victory Points Track \non the zero space.\n4.0 GAME SEQUENCE\n4.1 Twilight Struggle  has ten turns. Each turn represents between \nthree and five years, and will involve six or seven normal card \nplays by each player. At the beginning of the game, each player \nreceives eight cards from the Early War deck. At the beginning \nof turn 4, the Mid War deck is shuffled into the draw pile and the \nplayers\u2019 hand size increases to nine. At the beginning of turn 8, \nthe Late War deck is shuffled into the draw pile.\n4.2 The Phasing Player is the player whose Action Round is \ncurrently being played.\n4.3 When there are no cards remaining in the draw deck, reshuffle \nall discards to form a new draw deck. Note that cards played as \nEvents with an asterisk (*) are removed from the game when they \nare played, and are not shuffled into the new draw deck.\n4.3.1  Deal all cards remaining in the draw deck before reshuf -\nfling, except in turns 4 and 8 (see 4.4.). \n4.4 When moving from the Early War deck to Mid War, or from \nMid War to Late War, do not add in the discards to the deck\u2014in -\nstead add the Mid War or Late War cards (as appropriate) to the \nexisting deck and reshuffle. The ignored discards remain in the \ndiscard pile for now, but will be reshuffled into the deck in the \nnext reshuffle.\n4.5 A turn in Twilight Struggle  has the following structure:\n A.

Players may not forgo their turn by declining to play \na card, or by discarding a card from their hand.\n5.2 Events Associated With Your Opponent:  If a player plays \na card as an Operation, and the card\u2019s Event is associated only \nwith his opponent, the Event still occurs  (and the card, if it has \nan asterisk after the Event title, is removed).\nNOTE: When playing a card for operations and it triggers your \nopponent\u2019 s event, your opponent implements the event text as if \nthey had played the card themselves.\n\u2022 The phasing player always decides whether the event is to take \nplace before or after the Operations are conducted.\n\u2022 If a card play triggers an opponent\u2019s Event, but that Event \ncannot occur because a prerequisite card has not been played, \nor a condition expressed in the Event has not been met, the \nEvent does not occur. In this instance, cards with an asterisk \nEvent (marked *) are returned to the discard pile, not removed \nfrom the game.\n\u2022 If a card play triggers an opponent\u2019s Event, but play of that \nevent has been prohibited by a superseding Event card, then \nthe Event does not occur, and the card remains in play for \nOperations points only.\n\u2022 If a card play triggers an opponent\u2019s Event, but the event results \nin no effect, the Event is still considered played, and would \nstill be removed if it has an asterisk.EXAMPLE 1: The USSR player plays the \u2018NATO\u2019 card before the \n\u2018Marshall Plan\u2019 or \u2018Warsaw Pact\u2019 cards have been played. The \nUSSR player would get the benefit of the 4 Operations points, \nbut the US would not get the \u2018NATO\u2019 event. However, despite \nbeing asterisked, the \u2018NATO\u2019 card would not be removed from \nplay. It would be placed in the discard pile to be reshuffled and \npossibly played later.\nEXAMPLE 2: The US player plays \u2018Arab-Israeli War\u2019 for 2 Op -\nerations. However, during his previous Action Round he played \n\u2018Camp David Accords\u2019 which prohibits play of \u2018Arab-Israeli War\u2019 \nas an Event. The US player would still conduct 2 Operations, \nbut the USSR player would not get the benefit of the Event, and \nthe card would not be eliminated from the game.\nEXAMPLE 3: The USSR Player plays \u2018Alliance for Progress;\u2019 \nhowever, the US Player does not control a Battleground country \nin either South or Central America. Nevertheless, the Event is \nconsidered played, and the card would be removed from the game \nafter the USSR player\u2019 s round.\nEXAMPLE 4:  The USSR player plays \u2018Star Wars\u2019, but the US \nplayer is ahead on the Space Race track.  The result is no effect \nand the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 card is returned to the discard pile.\n5.3 When a card played as an Event requires the play or discard \nof another card of a specific value, a higher valued card will \nalways satisfy the requirement.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4069, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a22f9373-a88b-4e82-9ecc-1c0eab86024c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a22f9373-a88b-4e82-9ecc-1c0eab86024c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c12252d-5f1a-4a74-a9db-08b4412bf23e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "dd3edc479b51eae40c855bbcd7907cefe756b3018429632f35cb32494b90e4a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "058a9fe3-25e2-4c30-927f-888d981f1ddd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "9d2e202f1cfa9d2146ee652bbec303a0d27acd10963542fb7451b3f0e43f0e2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "21f86e4d-c89a-41dc-ae90-f3f8f24d138c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "252dd1a3748aa797771d77366e94d6195bc41b5ed436fd548ae18895c0e304eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The US player would still conduct 2 Operations, \nbut the USSR player would not get the benefit of the Event, and \nthe card would not be eliminated from the game.\nEXAMPLE 3: The USSR Player plays \u2018Alliance for Progress;\u2019 \nhowever, the US Player does not control a Battleground country \nin either South or Central America.

The US player uses a 3 Operations Point card \nto place more influence. The US player may place Influence \nmarkers in both Costa Rica and Colombia. However, he cannot \nplace Influence markers in Costa Rica and then Nicaragua. On \nthe other hand, since Influence markers are already present, he \ncould use any remaining operation points to strengthen South \nKorea or its neighboring countries.\n6.1.4  Influence markers may always be placed in any country \nthat is adjacent (connected) to the phasing player\u2019s superpower \nspace.\n6.1.5  Influence markers are treated like cash. Players may \n\u2018break\u2019 a large denomination into smaller denominations at any \ntime. Additionally, the number of Influence markers included \nin the game is not an absolute limit. Small poker chips, coins \nor wooden blocks can be utilized to substitute in the event of a \nmarker shortage. \n6.1.6  If a player has two or more markers in a country, place \nthe larger denomination on top. Influence markers are open to \ninspection at all times.\n6.2 REALIGNMENT ROLLS\n6.2.1  Realignment rolls are used to reduce enemy Influence in \na country. To attempt a Realignment roll, the acting player need \nnot have any Influence in the target country or in any adjacent \ncountry\u2014although this improves the chance of success greatly. \nWhen using a card for Realignment rolls, the player may resolve \neach roll before declaring the next target. Countries may be tar -\ngeted for Realignment more than once per Action Round.\n6.2.2  It costs one Operations point to make a Realignment roll. \nEach player rolls a die and the high roller may remove the dif -\nference between the rolls from their opponent\u2019s Influence in the \ntarget country. Ties are considered a draw, and no markers are \nremoved. Each player modifies his die roll:\n\u2022 +\u0018 for each adjacent controlled country,\n\u2022 +1 if they have more Influence in the target country than their \nopponent,\n\u2022 +\u0018 if your Superpower is adjacent to the target country.\n6.0 OPERATIONS\nOperations can be used in the following ways: to place Influence \nmarkers, to make Realignment rolls, to attempt Coups, or to at -\ntempt advancement in the Space Race. When a card is played as \nan Operations card, the player must choose to use all of the Opera -\ntions points on one of the following options: Marker Placement, \nRealignment rolls, Coup Attempts or a Space Race attempt.\n6.1 PLACING INFLUENCE MARKERS\n\u201cEveryone imposes his own system as far as his army can \nreach.\u201d \u2014Joseph Stalin\n6.1.1  Influence markers are placed one at a time. However, all \nmarkers must be placed with, or adjacent to, friendly markers that \nwere in place at the start of the phasing player\u2019s Action Round. \nException: markers placed when required by an Event are not \nsubject to this restriction, unless specifically stated otherwise on \nthe card. If the amount of influence is sufficent to gain control \nof the country, place the marker on its darker side.\n6.1.2  It costs one (1) Operations point to place an Influence \nmarker in a country that is friendly-Controlled or uncontrolled. \nIt costs two (2) Operations points to place an Influence marker \nin an enemy-Controlled country. If a country\u2019s Control status \nchanges while placing Influence markers, additional markers \nplaced during that Action Round are placed at the lower cost.\nEXAMPLE: The US player has 2 Influence markers in Turkey and \nthe USSR player has none. Therefore, the US controls Turkey. The \nUSSR player uses a 4 Operations point card to place Influence \nmarkers. When placing markers in Turkey, the first marker costs \n2 Operations points. However, after placement of the first USSR \ninfluence marker, the US no longer exceeds USSR influence in \nTurkey by the Stability Number of 2, thus, a second or third Soviet \ninfluence marker would only cost 1 operation point per marker. If \nthe US player started with only 1 influence marker in Turkey, the \nUS player would not control Turkey. Therefore, any Soviet influence \nplacement would only cost 1 operations point per marker.\nEXAMPLE: The US player controls Turkey and Greece and the \nUSSR player controls Syria and Lebanon.

The US player has no modifiers\u2014he does not \ncontrol any adjacent countries and has less Influence in North \nKorea then the Soviets. The USSR player has +1 because North \nKorea is adjacent to the USSR and +1 for having more Influence \nin North Korea then the US. The US player gets lucky and rolls \na 5 while the USSR player rolls a 2 which is modified to 4. The \nresult is the USSR player must remove one Influence point from \nNorth Korea. \n6.2.3  No Influence is ever added to a country as a result of a \nRealignment roll.\n6.3 COUP ATTEMPTS\n6.3.1  A Coup represents operations short of full-scale war to \nchange the composition of a target country\u2019s government. A \nplayer attempting a Coup need not have any Influence in the \ntarget country or in an adjacent country to attempt the Coup. \nHowever, your opponent must have Influence markers in the \ntarget country for a Coup to be attempted.\n6.3.2 To resolve a Coup attempt, multiply the Stability Number \nof the target country by two (x2).  Then roll a die and add the \nOperations points on the card to it.  If this modified die roll is \ngreater than the doubled stability number, the coup is success -\nful, otherwise it fails. If the coup is successful remove opposing \nInfluence markers equal to the difference from the target country. \nIf there are insufficient opposing Influence markers to remove, \nadd friendly Influence markers to make up the difference.\n6.3.3  Move the marker on the Military Operations track up \nthe number of spaces equal to the Operations value of the card \nplayed.\nEXAMPLE: The US player plays a 3 Operations card to conduct \na coup attempt in Mexico. The US player has no Influence in \nMexico; the USSR player has 2 Influence points. First the US \nplayer adjusts his marker on the Military Operations Track to \nshow that he has spent three points on \nMilitary Operations this turn (see 8.2). \nThen he rolls the die for a 4 and adds his \nOperations Number (3) to get a 7. He \nnow subtracts twice the value of Mexico\u2019 s \nStability Number (2x2=4) from this result \nto get a final total of 3. This is the num -\nber of Influence markers he may remove \nfrom/add to Mexico. First, the US would \nremove the 2 Soviet Influence markers, \nthen place 1 US Influence marker.\n6.3.4  Any Coup attempt in a Battleground country degrades the \nDEFCON status one level (towards Nuclear War).\n6.3.5  Cards that state a player may make a \u201cfree Coup roll\u201d in a \nparticular region may ignore the geographic restrictions of the \ncurrent DEFCON level (see 8. \u0018.5).

Yes or no?\u201d \n\u2014Adlai Stevenson, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations\n7.1 A player may play a card as an Event instead of Operations. \nIf the Event is associated with his or her own superpower, or is \nassociated with both superpowers, it takes effect as directed by \nthe card\u2019s text. \n7.2 The Southeast Asia Scoring card has an asterisk following the \nEvent title, and is the only scoring card removed after play.\n7.3 Permanent Events:  Some Event cards have an underlined \ntitle, e.g. Flower Power.  This indicates that the effects of these \nEvents last for the duration of the game. When such cards are \nplayed as Events, place them to the side of the map, or place \ntheir markers on the Turn Track, as a reminder of their ongoing \neffects.\n7.4 Some event cards modify the Operations value of cards that \nfollow. These modifiers should be applied in aggregate, and can \nmodify \u2018The China Card\u2019.\nEXAMPLE: The US player plays the Red Scare/Purge event \nduring the Headline Phase. Ordinarily, all USSR cards would \nsubtract one from their Operations value. However, for his \nHeadline card, the USSR played Vietnam Revolts. This event \ngives the Soviet player +1 to all operations played in SE Asia. \nFor his first play, the USSR chooses \u2018The China Card\u2019. He plays \nall points in SE Asia for 5 operations points. This is modified by \nthe Vietnam Revolts card, giving the USSR player 6 operation \npoints. However, the US Red Scare/Purge card brings the total \ndown to 5 operations points.\n7.4.1  Events modifying the Operations value of a card only apply \nto one player. The modifier is not transferable to their opponent \nby virtue of a card taken from their opponent\u2019s hand.\nEXAMPLE: The USSR player has played \u2018Brezhnev Doctrine\u2019 \nas an Event, and therefore receives a +1 Operations value \nmodifier for all of his cards. If the US player steals one of his \ncards, for example by playing \u2018Grain Sales to the Soviets\u2019, the \nUS player does not benefit from a +1 Operations value modifier \non that card.7.4.2  Events modifying the Operations value of subsequently \nplayed cards do so for all purposes.\nEXAMPLE 1:  If the Soviet player has played \u2018Red Scare/Purge\u2019 \non the US player, and the US player played a 2 Operations card \nfor a Coup, the US player would only add 1 to his Coup roll for \nthe value of the card, and would receive 1 point of the Required \nMilitary Operations track.\nEXAMPLE 2:  If the Soviet player played \u2018Brezhnev Doctrine\u2019 \nearlier in the turn, he could play a 1 Op card to make a required \nroll under \u2018Bear Trap\u2019.\nEXAMPLE 3: If the US player played \u2018Containment\u2019 earlier in the \nturn, he could play \u2018CIA Created\u2019 subsequently and use 2 Ops.\n7.5 If an Event becomes unplayable due to its cancellation or \nrestriction by another Event card, the unplayable Event card may \nstill be used for its Operations value.\n7.6 War Events:  There are 5 \u201cWar\u201d Events in the deck: Korean \nWar, Arab-Israeli War, Indo-Pakistani War, Brush War, and \nIran-Iraq War.

Re -\ngional Victory Points are scored through geographic Influence \nover the six Regions. VPs can \nalso be received through the play \nof certain Events. Each region has \nits own \u2018scoring card\u2019. Playing a \nscoring card causes Victory Points \nto be scored, based on how much \ninfluence each superpower has in \nthat region at the time the card is \nplayed.\nPLAY NOTE: Trying to play scor -\ning cards to coincide with your \nsuperpower\u2019 s peak influence in a \nregion is often a crucial factor in \nwinning the game.\n10.1 SCORING \n10.1.1  The following terms are used during Regional Scoring:\nPresence:  A superpower has Presence in a Region if it Controls \nat least one country in that Region.\nDomination:  A superpower achieves Domination of a Region if \nit Controls more countries in that Region than its opponent, and \nit Controls more Battleground countries in that Region than its \nopponent. A superpower must Control at least one non-Battle -\nground and one Battleground country in a Region in order to \nachieve Domination of that Region.\nControl:  A superpower has Control of a Region if it Controls \nmore countries in that Region than its opponent, and Controls \nall of the Battleground countries in that Region.\n10.1.2  Players score additional points during Regional Scoring, \nas follows:\n\u2022 +\u0018 VP per country they Control in the scoring region that is \nadjacent to the enemy superpower \n\u2022 +\u0018 VP per Battleground country that they Control in the scor -\ning region.\n\u2022 Victory points are then cumulated for both players, and the net \ndifference between the two scores is marked on the Victory \nPoint Track.\nEXAMPLE: The USSR plays the Central American Scoring \ncard. The USSR controls Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Re -\npublic. The United States controls Guatemala, and has 1 point \nof influence in Panama. The USSR player would therefore get \npoints for Dominating Central America (3 VPs) + 1 VP for con -\ntrol of a battleground country (Cuba). +1 VP for Cuba\u2019s being \nadjacent to your opponent\u2019s home nation for a total of 5 VPs. \nThe United States would receive 1 VP for presence in Central \nAmerica since he controls Guatemala. Since the United States \nonly has 1 Influence point in Panama, he does not control it, \nand therefore controls no battleground countries. That is why \nthe USSR player scores Dominance points. He controls more battleground countries (Cuba) and more countries overall. He \nalso meets the \u201cat least one non-battleground country\u201d test \nthrough control of either Haiti or the Dominican Republic. Hav -\ning calculated relative victory points, 5 VPs for the USSR, and \n1 VP for the US, you subtract the US VPs from the Soviets, and \nmove the VP point track a net 4 spaces toward Soviet victory.\n10.1.3  Playing certain card Events may result in Victory Points \nbeing scored.\n10.1.4  Victory Points may be scored due to your opponent\u2019s \nfailure to perform the number of required military operations \nduring the turn (8.2).\n10.1.5   A player may not be forced to Hold a Scoring Card through \nthe effects of an Event(s).\n10.2 The Victory Point Track\n10.2.1 The Victory Point Track shows a range of scoring possibili -\nties from US-20 (US automatic victory) to USSR-20 (USSR auto -\nmatic victory).

This prevents ac -\ncidental or deliberate holding of scoring cards. \n11.1.2  Any player found holding a scoring card during the Reveal \nHeld Card phase is said to have started an accidental nuclear war, \nand loses immediately.  \n11.1.3  During tournament play, the Soviet player should receive \nthe first card of every deal. The deal should alternate back and \nforth between the players until they have received their full \nhand size. A player may receive consecutive cards in a deal if \nthey require more cards than their opponent.\n12.0 THE CHINESE CIVIL WAR \nV ARIANT\nThe Chinese Civil War Variant \nis meant to be played within \nthe context of the existing \nrules regarding the China \nCard (see 9.0).  However, \nwhere these rules conflict with \nexisting rules or event card \ntext, this section of the rules \ntakes precedence. \n12.1 The Chinese Civil War space\nThe Chinese Civil War space is considered adjacent to the Soviet \nUnion and only the Soviet Union.  The space is considered to be \nin Asia, but not South East Asia.  It does not affect any scoring \ncard. The only action that may be taken on the Chinese Civil War \nspace is the placement of Influence Points by the Soviet player.  \nThe US player may not use Operations or events of any kind to \neffect the Chinese Civil War space. Once the Soviet player has \nplaced 3 Influence Points on the Chinese Civil War space, it has \nno further effect.  The markers may be returned to the Soviet \nplayer\u2019s pool, and the Chinese Civil War space is ignored for \nthe remainder of the game.12.2 Control\nThe Soviet Union must place three Influence on the Chinese \nCivil War space to Control it.  Soviet Influence is placed in the \nChinese Civil War space according to the rules for placing influ -\nence in countries (see 6.\u0018). If the China card remains unclaimed \nthroughout the game, no player receives the victory point for \npossession of the China Card during end game scoring.   \n12.3 Impact of Control\nUntil the Soviet Player has placed 3 Influence Points on the \nChinese Civil War space, the China Card is in no player\u2019s pos -\nsession.   Once the Soviet player had placed 3 Influence Points \ninto the space, the player immediately receives the China Card \nface up and ready for play.  Additionally, the ban on play of the \nRed Scare/Purge and Formosan Resolution events is immedi -\nately lifted. \n12.4 Event Restrictions\nUntil the Soviet player has placed 3 Influence Points on the \nChinese Civil War space, the Soviet player may not play Red \nScaRe/PuRge  nor cultuRal  Revolution  as events.  Additionally, \nthe US player may not play Formosan Resolution as an event.  \nThese cards may be played for Operations Points normally.  \n12.4.1 Special US Condition:  For the purposes of playing uS-\nSuRi RiveR SkiRmiSh  or nixon PlayS the china caRd as events, \nthe US is deemed to be in possession of the China Card if the \nSoviet Player has not yet placed the 3 Influence Points on the \nChinese Civil War space. \n12.4.2  Until the Soviet Player has placed 3 Influence Points \non the Chinese Civil War space the Russian player subtracts \nan additional \u0018 when rolling for the resolution of the koRean  \nWaR event. \n12.4.3  Events made unplayable or restricted due to \u00182.4 are still \nplayable for Operations points as per rule 7.5.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3988, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3837a315-5490-46fb-8a44-c88ecc4910a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3837a315-5490-46fb-8a44-c88ecc4910a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "648b34f2-bb46-4a94-bf88-588db03030ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "e1106a5840da82a4ef886e01d849c5511a48f9d020e57b6d046f832f4be8d7dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ba8c7ca-a49b-443f-b7ca-fb064b03f311", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "53e4ef61cfb022d5fbc9bb61d53dd5863988d588cd527750a7fe459d57a4ca2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e07b73d-fe19-4bfc-8535-0a96c1c2bb54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5075f4a653126674a26c7aa3d5e7f00fd3fd2c13471b9a49ee7c59c8f4cfd9af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Twilight Struggle  \u20142nd Edition\u2014 \u00182\n\u00a9 2007 GMT Games, LLCA Late War Scenario for Twilight Struggle\nBy Volko Ruhnke\nC3i Magazine #19, copyright RBM Studio\nIf you\u2019ve played with your TS set as much as I have, you may \nfind the Early and Mid-War event cards looking a little worn \ncompared to the less often used Late War events. For those of \nyou who would like to dive right into the post-Quagmire era \nand try out the cool possibilities of a Landed Eagle, Star Wars, \nand Chernobyl, or Aldrich Ames, the Hostage Crisis, and Ter -\nrorism, here\u2019s a scenario that cuts to the chase. \nMy sense of the game-turn structure is that the turns roughly \nrepresent the following years: \nTurn \u0018 = \u0018945-\u0018948 \nTurn 2 = \u0018949-\u0018952 Turn 3 = \u0018953-\u0018956 Turn 4 = \u0018957-\u0018960 Turn 5 = \u001896\u0018-\u0018964 Turn 6 = \u0018965-\u0018969 Turn 7 = \u0018970-\u0018974 Turn 8 = \u0018975-\u0018979 Turn 9 = \u0018980-\u0018984 Turn \u00180 = \u0018985-\u0018989. \nThus, the Late War period would begin in \u0018975, say, with the \nFall of Saigon. So I have used that date (and a dose of inter -\npretation of history into the TS fabric) to set the influence and \nevents for the opening of the Late War Scenario. \nTo my surprise, the US appears to begin the post-Vietnam \nera in a decidedly strong position in game turns. Whether or \nnot the dominoes have fallen, the US still dominates Asia, for \nexample. Play of the scenario showed that a US Automatic \nVictory is well within reach, so the Soviet player in this sce -\nnario wins just for engineering a more graceful decline of the \nSocialist experiment. \nHave fun, and please try to avoid The Day After\u2026.\nMarkers: \n\u2022 Turn at 8 \n\u2022 DEFCON at 4 \n\u2022 Space Race at Soviet Space Walk; US Eagle Landed \n\u2022 VP at -4 \nEvents in play counters\nUS/Japan Pact, Marshall Plan, NATO, Warsaw Pact, DeGaulle, \nFlower Power.

Tournament GMs are \nwelcome to incorporate some or all of these rules into their \ntournaments, provided notice is given to players.\nRealignment Rolls\nWe tried many variations on the rules for Realignments. One \nof the great design challenges in TS was figuring out a simple \nsystem to handle superpower-directed political change that \nwasn\u2019t violent enough to count as a Coup attempt. We are \nhappy with the rules we arrived with, but if players wish to \nsee some of the other paths we tried, here they are. They can \nbe played with separately or all together.\nRealignment rolls are not subject to geographic DEFCON re -\nstrictions. That is, countries in any regions may be targeted for \nRealignment rolls regardless of the current DEFCON level.\nThe phasing player may not lose Influence in a country tar -\ngeted for Realignment.\nOperations points may be used to purchase both Influence \nmarkers and Realignment rolls, at normal costs, but Influ -\nence markers may not be placed in a country already targeted \nwith a Realignment roll during the current action round, \nand Realignment rolls may not be targeted at countries \nthat have had Influence markers placed in them during the \ncurrent action round.\nThe Space Race\nA player who \u201cdumps\u201d a card on the Space Race may, at his \nchoice, elect not to roll the die (thus forgoing any chance of \nadvancing on the track).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2519, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "443c0801-051d-4be0-ba23-9c786e36c693": {"__data__": {"id_": "443c0801-051d-4be0-ba23-9c786e36c693", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f094f85d-a1a7-453e-b6fe-6558acb206a7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "7d3d0cdb6273b91ae874cc66f67f972b450aeb3266621d83732ae23f737185cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e07b73d-fe19-4bfc-8535-0a96c1c2bb54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "a34420037dbd9cea43db3bab37501ed050bdb707f81f57273b4c692a54c5817f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "da84f894-9221-4f8b-9dbd-af32e181009b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b571a7036e0213c6a24b64524d1e2dea7054a888c1d323e1d0ac8389fde4518", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Twilight Struggle  \u20142nd Edition\u2014 \u00184\n\u00a9 2007 GMT Games, LLCExtended Example of Play\nWhat follows is an example of play taken from the finals of the \nBoardgame Players Association online tournament. This final \nfeatures two of the finest Twilight Struggle  players in the country\u2014\nChris Withers and Stefan Mecay. Stefan has won every Twilight \nStruggle  tournament held at the World Boardgaming Champion -\nships. Chris, on the other hand, was the only player to hand Stefan \na defeat in the preliminary rounds of this tournament.\nIn this game, none of the optional cards are in play. Additionally, \nthe two players have bid for sides. Chris wins the bidding and \nchooses the Soviets. Stefan takes the underdogs, but due to bid -\nding his US begins the game with an additional four Influence \nPoints. These points may only be placed in countries eligible for \nUS Influence during the game setup.\nTo help players follow along, the number of Influence Points in a \ncountry after the action is performed is indicated in parenthesis. \nThe number before the slash is US influence and the number \nafter the slash is USSR influence (US/USSR). If the number is \nbold and with a \u201cC\u201d, it indicates control.\nSoviet Setup:  4 IP to Poland (0/ 4C), 1 IP to East Germany (0/ 4C), \n1 IP to Yugoslavia (0/1). \nUS Setup:  2 IP to West Germany (2/0), 4 IP to Italy ( 4C/0), 1 \nIP to France (1/0); \nBonus Bid  = \u0018 IP to Iran ( 2C/0), 2 IP to France ( 3C/0), 2 IP to \nWest Germany ( 4C/0).\nThis is a fairly standard setup. Note that the decision on where \nto put your starting influence is made AFTER you examine your \nstarting hand. The Soviets have locked down Poland and East \nGermany. They\u2019ve put 1 Influence in Yugoslavia to threaten Italy \nand Greece. That 1 IP is always a risk, as it can be flipped by \nIndependent Reds.Stefan is attempting to deprive the Soviets of any obvious first \ncoup locations by using the bid IPs to strengthen Iran. Fur -\nthermore, he has bolstered the US position in Western Europe, \nsuch that an initial European Scoring Card would result in US \ndominance.\nTURN 1\nHeadline Phase\nSoviet: olymPic  gameS  (2 Ops)\nUS: mideaSt  ScoRing  (0 Ops)\nIn this phase both players choose a card from their hand. The \nevent on that card will then be implemented. The card with the \nhighest operations is implemented first. In the event of a tie, the US Card is implemented first. \nStefan has made a risky choice by playing the Mideast Scoring \ncard right off the bat. Had the Soviets played a headline card that \nallowed them to place Influence, those IPs would certainly have \nplopped down in the Mideast making this stealth play a potential \nnightmare. Unfortunately for Chris, his headline card is a non-\nthreatening effort to nail a couple of early victory points. \nThe US Scores 4 for the Mideast Scoring (control of Iran) and \nthe Soviets win the first post-war Olympics. The net result is \nUS +2.\nAction Rounds\nUSSR Action Round 1:  NATO (4 Ops) to Coup Iran. Rolls 6, \nUS influence = 0, Soviet Influence 4. Soviets gain 4 Mil Ops, \nand DEFCON drops to 4. \nThis is the classical opening move. Iran is the linchpin to the US \nposition to the Middle East and ultimately \nto the South Asian prizes of Afghanistan, \nPakistan and India. Because of the extra \ninfluence from the starting bid, it takes a \nlarger card to ensure success. Chris does \nso with a big roll. Mr. Truman must be \nasleep at the wheel while the dominoes \nare falling.\nUS Action Round 1:  FoRmoSan  ReSolu -\ntion (2 Ops) as Influence points. Adds \n1 to Malaysia (1/0) and 1 to Columbia \n(1/0).\nStefan appears to be creating a bit of a \ndilemma here for the Soviet player. He is \nthreatening the key Asian battleground in \nThailand while also threatening to break \n#1: At Start setup in Europe and upper Middle East.Extended Example of Play", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3810, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da84f894-9221-4f8b-9dbd-af32e181009b": {"__data__": {"id_": "da84f894-9221-4f8b-9dbd-af32e181009b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "590dcfa8-006e-484f-97e8-f2437706fca9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "9f50e7e25d2a1c6adbe962ed57e1f1283bd9e6dee4b9ab16a992a742bffc3d4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "443c0801-051d-4be0-ba23-9c786e36c693", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "7d3d0cdb6273b91ae874cc66f67f972b450aeb3266621d83732ae23f737185cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d013b60-57b7-4063-9ade-a9b1ac8aa433", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f67fb3667fa558f3030949932d1ba7d4216bb84bbe73560766a8eda6a0216508", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Twilight Struggle  \u20142nd Edition\u2014 \u00185\n\u00a9 2007 GMT Games, LLCout in South America. Without an interesting event, the Soviet \nplayer can only deal with one of these problems via a coup. The \nSouth American play is an illustration of mid-term planning. \nHowever, a key to good Twilight Struggle play is switching the \ntempo of the game by putting your opponent on the defensive. \nDoing so requires players to stop reacting, and engage in a little \nplanning. That\u2019 s exactly what Stefan is trying to do. \nUSSR Action Round 2:  de-Stalinization  (3 Ops) as the Event. \nAdds 1 to Chile (0/1), Venezuela (0/1), Thailand (0/1) and Ma -\nlaysia (1/1) taken from Finland (0/0), Yugoslavia (0/0) and 2 \nfrom Iran (0/2).\nUnfortunately for Stefan, Chris\u2019 Soviets have the perfect counter. \nChris would probably have preferred to have a little more influ -\nence on the board before he started reshuffling it to deal with \nStefan\u2019 s challenge, but still, this will do. Suddenly, Chris is on \nthe offensive in both South America and Asia.\nUS Action Round 2:  containment  (3 Ops) to Coup Thailand. \nRolls \u0018, No effect. US gains 3 Mil Ops, and DEFCON drops \nto 3.\nSwing and a miss. This was a major missed opportunity for the Americans. The Soviets felt compelled to \nmove into Thailand even though it was still \nunder a Coup threat given the DEFCON \nlevel. US success here would have truly \ngrounded the American position in Asia. \nIndia and Pakistan would quickly be on the \nwatch list. But it was not to be.\nUSSR Action Round 3:  COMECON (3 Ops) as Influence points. \nAdds 1 to Thailand (0/ 2C), Venezuela (0/ 2C) and Afghanistan \n(0/1).\nChris uses the breather afforded by the Americans\u2019 failed coup in \nThailand to solidify his position there, and in South American.

US gains 5 VP, \nfor total of 7. \nThe player focus on the Midwar shows some impact here. US \nposition in Europe has not really been touched. Stefan is free to \ngrab a quick 5 points with Europe Scoring without much ado \nfrom the Soviets. \nUSSR Action Round 5:  tRuman  doctRine  (1 Op - US) as Influ -\nence Points. Adds 1 to Thailand (0/ 3C). \nChris plays a US event. Ordinarily, Truman Doctrine might have \nnipped Chris with the Soviet Influence in Yugoslavia. However, \nthat Influence Point was removed earlier for De-Stalinization. So, \nthough the US got the event, it had no effect and was discarded \nout of the deck. \nUS Action Round 5:  Korean War (2 Ops - USSR) as Influence \nPoints. Adds 2 to South Korea (2/0). See Illustration #3. \nThings are getting bad for the US. The Asian scoring card is \nstill out there. If Stefan does not take some risks, it could be a \nshort game. So, he plays Korean War and chances the roll. This \ntime, the \u201c1\u201d roll works in his favor. The North Korean invasion \nhas no effect. The futures of Hyundai and Samsung are secure. \nFurthermore, the US player uses the occasion to starting build -\ning a wall of his own.\nUSSR Action Round 6:  degaulle  leadS FRance  (3 Ops) as \nInfluence Points. Adds 1 to Afghanistan (0/ 2C), 2 to Pakistan \n(0/2C).\nFearing the US player has the Asian scoring card, Chris reacts \nto Stefan\u2019 s Korean gambit by attacking Asia\u2019 s soft underbelly\u2014Pakistan. Furthermore, with Europe Scoring already played, \nPresident De Gaulle seems less appealing as an event play. \nUS Action Round 6:  cia cReated  (1 Op) as Influence Points. \nAdds 1 to Jordan (1/0). See Illustration #4.\nThe US wants to get back into the Middle East. He chooses Jordan \nas his entry point. Note that Stefan does not use the event. That\u2019 s \nbecause he wants to keep it in the deck as a potential trap for the \nSoviet player. Furthermore, CIA Created is the kind of card you \nwant to play at the beginning of the turn to maximize the value of the intelligence garnered. \nTURN 2\n(DEFCON increases to 3, Mil Ops requirements met by both \nplayers, no lost points)\nHeadline Phase\nSoviet: Red ScaRe (4 Ops)\nUS: indo-PakiStani  WaR (2 Ops)\nRed ScaRe/PuRge is a killer card and is almost reflexively played \nas a headline card if you get your hands on it.

By leading with \nindo-PakiStani  WaR he can potentially make that scoring card \nsomething to anticipate rather than dread. \nAmerican efforts, however, come up just a bit short.

Chris knows he \nwon\u2019t see euRoPean  ScoRing  again until the Midwar reshuffle, \naround the start of turn 7. \nChris\u2019 play in South East Asia improves his position both for a\nSian ScoRing  and also for the Mid War deck\u2019 s, South  eaSt aSian \nScoRing  card.\nUS Action Round 3:  olym Pic game S (2 Ops) as Influence points. \nAdds 2 to Israel (3/0).\nStefan is bound and determined not to let the Middle East fall \naway. He\u2019 s got Europe, he\u2019 s lost Asia. Things look pretty grim in \nLatin America and Africa. If he let\u2019 s his position in the Middle \nEast collapse, Chris is a shoe in. So, Israel is now increasingly \nsafe against an aRab-iSRaeli  WaR play, and therefore gets some \nUS love. USSR Action Round 4:  aSia ScoRing  (0 Ops). USSR gains 6 \nVP, for a total of 2.\nAgain, no surprise. Chris telegraphed this move early with the v\nietna M Revolt S play. What is surprising is that despite some fine \nplay by Chris and an excellent set of cards, the VP chart has not \ndipped into Soviet territory\u2014yet.\nUS Action Round 4: aRaB-iSRaeli  WaR (2 Op) as Influence \npoints. Adds \u0018 to Israel ( 4C/0) and 1 to Jordan ( 2C/0).\nVery cleverly defused. Stefan uses the two ops from the card \nto take advantage of the modifiers on the event. Since he now \ncontrols Israel, Egypt and Jordan it is impossible for the Soviet \ndie roll to succeed. Still, the Soviets do collect 2 Mil Ops out of \nthe deal. A very nice tactical play that rendered a Soviet event \nuseless while also improving Stefan\u2019 s boots on the ground in the Middle East. \nUSSR Action Round 5:  NATO (4 Ops - US) as Influence points. \nAdds 1 to Syria (0/ 2C), Brazil (0/ 2C) and 2 to Chile (0/ 3C). \nThe Soviets trigger NATO, but Europe is hardly his target, or \nconcern, these days. Instead he parries a bit in the Middle East \nand turns up the heat in South America. \nUS Action Round 5: un inteR vention  (2 Ops) with Blockade  \n(1 Op) as the event. Adds 1 in Libya (1/0). \nUgh, I hate leaving blockade  in the deck under any circumstanc -\nes, but this is obviously better than playing it. Since blockade  is \na 1 Op, it does not meet the requirements for a Space Race roll. \nThe move over to Libya signals Stefan\u2019 s desire to dominate the \nMiddle East, not just play defense. However, naSSeR  could make \na mess of position in Egypt quite quickly. #7: The Situation in Europe at the time of Europe Scoring.\n #8: The Situation in Asia at the time of Asia Scoring.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3329, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c06f4e49-81f3-4385-8d9a-5440d7ed161f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c06f4e49-81f3-4385-8d9a-5440d7ed161f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a2307a5-7dc7-4280-bd02-a642782fa857", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3838aff331acd14008532905587fd50dd9f253dd47aea61b3e27bab209e44e21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2a988de-de0d-4b7e-8e12-a66058da5122", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "e09de5b9aa54e1cc89309f6e1178811def6456f7f8665d6e0451a6f4ea4612d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c3b847b-6840-4c56-9860-50dad92c0bd2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad9aaf135c88b51551b178aa72f0204e2ab11b3c616ba7614b6299014a8b3c1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Twilight Struggle  \u20142nd Edition\u2014 20\n\u00a9 2007 GMT Games, LLC\n#9: The Situation at the end of Turn 3.\nUSSR Action Round 6:  nuclea R teSt Ban (4 Ops) as Influence \npoints.

I would also \nlike to thank the Board Game Player\u2019s Association for hosting \nthis tournament and others like it. They are a great service to all \ngamers.

From the Chinese Civil War, \nto the Korean War to Vietnam and Afghanistan, Asia was the place \nwhere the Cold War came closest to growing hot. For this reason, \nAsia is the second most significant region for scoring. \nEUROPE SCORING  \u2014 Some Cold War historians view the entire \nstruggle, costing millions of lives, untold trillions of dollars, and \nconflict around the globe, as a struggle for the future of Germany. \nWhile that view may be too myopic, it is clear that Europe always \nremained in the forefront of strategy and emphasis. Defeat in Europe \nultimately meant defeat in the Cold War. \nMIDEAST SCORING  \u2014 In \u0018946, Truman had to threaten to send \nwarships to the Mediterranean to compel the Soviets to remove \ntroops from Iran. Thus began the Cold War struggle in the Middle \nEast. Since this region provided Western economies with their life-\nblood\u2014oil, it also provided the USSR with an irresistible opportunity \nto meddle. US support for Israel gave the Soviets an opening to the \nArab world that they would repeatedly exploit. \nDUCK AND COVER \u2014 (\u0018950) The US Congress passed into law \nthe Federal Civil Defense Act, in reaction to the first Soviet tests \nof nuclear weapons in \u0018949. Duck and Cover is perhaps the most \nmemorable of a variety of civil defense efforts to raise awareness of \nnuclear attack. Ironically, such films may have assisted in increasing \nthe possibility of nuclear war by making the possibility of such a conflict \u201cthinkable\u201d by the general public. \nFIVE YEAR PLAN  \u2014 ( \u0018946- \u0018950) Beginning in the \u0018920s, \nthe Soviet Union became obsessed with centralized planning of \nits economy and industrial development. Twelve such plans were \nadopted by the USSR during its history. While economists differ, \nit is largely agreed that these plans caused more dislocation within \nthe Soviet economy than they resolved. \nTHE CHINA CARD \u2014 The People\u2019s Republic of China played \na pivotal role during the Cold War. While the PRC\u2019s influence was \nlargely limited to satellites in Asia, the country was important to \nthe uneasy balance of power that ultimately descended upon the \npost-WWII world. While beginning as an ally of the USSR, China \nbecame a counter-balance to Soviet influence in Asia during the \nlater stages of the Cold War. \nSOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS  \u2014 \n(\u0018947) Beginning with the end of the \nSecond World War, the US was chal -\nlenged by democratic leftist movements \nwithin its sphere. Italy, under de Gasperi, \nwas particularly contentious with com -\nmunists and socialists participating in \ngovernment. The CIA funded an exten -\nsive propaganda program against these \nmovements. Socialist governments would \nbe the topic of concern again during the \u0018960s in France, and with left-wing labor \nparty in the UK. FIDEL  \u2014 ( \u0018959) Coming to power after deposing the corrupt \nBatista, Castro disenchanted the US after it became clear he was \nleading a Marxist revolution. The US tried various schemes to \ndepose or assassinate Castro, culminating in the disastrous \u201cBay of \nPigs\u201d invasion. Ultimately, communist Cuba would lend support to \nMarxist governments in Angola and Ethiopia. \nVIETNAM REVOLTS \u2014 (\u0018946) Ho Chi Minh tried repeatedly \nto enlist the aid of the Truman Administration for independence. \nHis letters never received a response. The French government, with \nsupport from the US and Britain, attempted to reestablish its colony \nin Indochina. The attempted was doomed and would lead to disaster \nat Dien Bien Phu. \nBLOCKADE  \u2014 ( \u0018948-49) The Soviets attempted to increase \npressure on the Western allies to dissuade them from creating an \nindependent \u201cWest\u201d German government in their zones.

There were \u00185 nations beyond \nthe US and South Korea with combat forces attempting to defend \nSouth Korean independence. MacArthur\u2019s campaign to the Yalu \nRiver provoked a Chinese response that reset the war to its starting \npositions on the 38th parallel. \nROMANIAN ABDICATION  \u2014 (\u0018947) King Michael I, a west -\nernized monarch, was forced to abdicate his throne at gunpoint. \nRomania was thereafter declared a democratic socialist republic. \nAfter the death of its first communist leader, Gheorghiu-Dej, Ro -\nmania was ruled by Nicolae Ceausescu, second only to Stalin in \ncruelty to his own people. \nARAB-ISRAELI WAR  \u2014 ( \u0018948-49, \n\u0018956, \u0018967, \u0018968- \u0018970, \u0018973, \u0018982) \nThe State of Israel was virtually born of \nwar. After the end of the British mandate, \nIsrael was thrust into conflict with its Arab \nneighbors. Israel prevailed in all such \nwars, excepting its invasion of Lebanon in \u0018982, from which it ultimately had \nto withdraw. Arab success was nearly \nachieved during the surprise attacks of \nthe Yom Kippur War, however these \ntoo ultimately failed. While superpower \nintervention was frequently threatened on both sides, ultimately \nsuccess or failure in the conflicts rode upon the relative capabilities \nof Arab and Israeli militaries. \nCOMECON  \u2014 (\u0018949-\u001899\u0018) The Council for Mutual Economic \nAssistance (COMECON) was founded in reaction to the allure of the \nMarshall Plan to the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe. While very \nloosely organized and dominated by the Soviets in its early years, \nCOMECON would ultimately fulfill the role of trade liberalization \nand industrial rationalization for Eastern Europe.

Egypt, under his leadership, was viewed as a \nSoviet client, and would serve as a Russian proxy during repeated \nwars with Israel. He died in office after 18 years of service, having \nfrustrated the attempts of a variety of domestic and international \nenemies. \nWARSAW PACT FORMED  \u2014 (\u0018955) A reaction to perceived \nWestern aggression by the creation of NATO, the Warsaw Pact was \na Russian-dominated military alliance that included all of the states \nof Eastern Europe except Yugoslavia. It integrated both tactics and \nequipment throughout the alliance along Soviet models. Albania \nwithdrew from the Pact in \u0018968. \nDE GAULLE LEADS FRANCE  \n\u2014 (\u0018958 \u2013 \u0018969) Founder of France\u2019s \nFifth Republic, De Gaulle\u2019s role during \nthe Cold War is generally viewed through \nthe lens of his second presidency. While \nstill a western ally, De Gaulle attempted \nto establish France as an independent \nvoice within the confines of the western \ncamp. He developed an independent \nnuclear deterrent, withdrew from NATO\u2019s \nunified command structure, and criticized \nUS policy in Vietnam.

Stalin was reportedly confounded by Soviet \nfailure to grab this knowledge base first. \nTRUMAN DOCTRINE  \u2014 ( \u0018947) \nBefore a joint session of Congress, the \nPresident announced the new Truman \nDoctrine, ushering in an era of intense \nintervention on behalf of states with lib -\neral economic and political institutions. \nTruman stated \u201cI believe that it must be \nthe policy of the United States to support \nfree peoples who are resisting attempted \nsubjugation by armed minorities or by \noutside pressures.\u201d The Truman Doctrine \nwas prompted by the United Kingdom\u2019s \nwithdrawal from its traditional great power role in the Near East. \nThe immediate effect of the doctrine was a massive influx of military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey. \nOLYMPIC GAMES  \u2014 ( \u0018948, \u0018952, \u0018956, \u0018960, \u0018964, \u0018968, \n\u0018972, \u0018976, \u0018980, \u0018984, \u0018988) Sport often served as an outlet for the \nintense competition between the Superpowers, and that competition \nwas never so intense as at the Olympics. The Olympics served as a \ntest bed to see which society could make the greatest strides in hu -man physical achievement. It fit neatly into Communist ideology of \n\u201cthe New Man.\u201d The games frequently reflected the global political \nsituation, as with the terrorist attacks in Munich, and became overt political tools with the US boycott of the Moscow games in \u0018980, \nand the Soviet boycott of the LA games in \u0018984. \nNATO \u2014 (\u0018949) The second part of the US strategy to rebuild \nEurope, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) became \nsynonymous with the West\u2019s opposition to the Soviet Union.

In \ndoing so, it also soothed the nerves of \nJapan\u2019s neighbors about a remilitarized \nJapan appearing on the world scene.

Threatened by Nasser\u2019s nationalization of \nthe Suez Canal, Israel, France and the United Kingdom conspired \nto alter Egyptian policy at bayonet point. They failed to appreciate \nEisenhower\u2019s aggravation at their unannounced initiative. Though \ninitially militarily successful, the three powers were compelled to \nwithdraw under American pressure. \nEAST EUROPEAN UNREST  \u2014 (\u0018956 \n\u2013 \u0018989) Captured most visibly by Nagy\u2019s \nattempt to withdraw Hungary from the \nWarsaw Pact and Czechoslovakia\u2019s Prague Spring of \u0018968, members of the \nWarsaw Pact frequently sought to loosen \nthe reins of Moscow. When taken too \nfar, from the Soviet perspective, the ef -\nfects could be devastating.

Sparking the \nretreat from empire was Britain\u2019s fulfilled promise of independence \nfor India in 1947. At the other extreme, Rhodesia\u2019s first majority \nelections spelled doom for the apartheid system. \nRED SCARE/PURGE  \u2014 (\u0018945 \u2013 \u0018989) Sparked by fears that \nthe \u201cenemy is among us,\u201d the \u201cred scare\u201d hit its apex with Senator \nJoseph McCarthy, and the hearings on \u201cUn-American activities\u201d in the House of Representatives during the \u0018950s. Soviet purges were \na notorious aspect of power transition within the Kremlin. However, Stalin was the true master; \u00182 million people were imprisoned in \nhis camps at the time of his death in \u0018953. \nUN INTERVENTION  \u2014 ( \u0018947 \u2013 ?) \nThe United Nations remained generally \nunable to influence the struggle between \nthe superpowers due to Security Council \nveto power throughout the Cold War. \nHowever, it occasionally stood as a gauge \nfor world opinion, and could mediate in \nstalled conflicts throughout the Third \nWorld. It was also the backdrop for a \nnumber of quintessential moments of \nthe conflict, including the Soviet Korean \nWar walkout, the \u201cWe Will Bury You\u201d \nspeech, and of course, the Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014don\u2019t wait for the \ntranslation Mr. Zorin! \nDE-STALINIZATION  \u2014 (\u0018956) During the 20th Party Congress, \nNikita Khrushchev openly attacked Stalin\u2019s leadership of the Soviet \nUnion. It was seen both inside and outside the Soviet Union as the \nbeginning of a new era. This proved to be a particularly bloody \nassumption for Nagy\u2019s Hungary. Khrushchev had no intention of \n\u201cliberalizing\u201d Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, even if he was \ntrying to bring an end to the cult of personality that had character -\nized internal Soviet government. \nNUCLEAR TEST BAN \u2014 (1963 \u2013 ?) The first Nuclear Test Ban \ntreaty owes its origins to the de-escalation process that followed the Cuban Missile Crisis. It prohibited further nuclear tests in the \nair, underwater or in space. International pressure for such a ban \nmounted in the 1950s as scientific evidence began to document \nsevere environmental damage caused by earlier atmospheric testing \nby the nuclear powers. Underground testing remained an allowable \nmethodology, but all forms of \u201cpeaceful nuclear explosions\u201d were also banned, tightening the non-proliferation regime. \nSOUTH AMERICAN SCORING  \u2014 The regional penchant to turn \nto strong men or military juntas to resolve questions of instability \nmade South America ripe for leftist reaction throughout the Cold \nWar. Rising nationalism and the world-wide wave of anti-imperialist \nsentiment also characterized the relationship with the United States \nand the nations of South America.

Also characterized as low intensity \nconflicts, brush wars tended to begin in reaction to local conditions \neither within a state or between states. However, due to duration, \nor superpower intervention, an essentially local dispute could be \nelevated to superpower conflict. Examples include the civil war in \nMozambique and the war between Ethiopia and Somalia. \nCENTRAL AMERICAN SCORING  \u2014 Central America and the \nCaribbean were frequently termed America\u2019s \u201cbackyard\u201d and \u201clake.\u201d With the advent of Fidel Castro in the \u0018959, Americans could no \nlonger take the region for granted. The US reaction to communist \ninfluence in the area provoked direct US military intervention in the Dominican Republic (\u0018965) and Grenada (\u0018983). In the closing \nyears of the Cold War, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras, became \nfrontline states in the struggle between the superpowers. \nSOUTHEAST ASIA SCORING  \u2014 In Southeast Asia the process \nof decolonization intertwined with superpower rivalry in particu -\nlarly deadly ways. Beginning with the British counter-insurgency \nin Malaya, to the US wars in Vietnam and Cambodia, and ending in \u0018979 with the Sino-Vietnamese war, Southeast Asia would command \nAmerican attention like no other region. However, after America\u2019s \nhumiliating withdrawal from the region, it would cease to play a \ncentral role in Cold War politics. \nARMS RACE \u2014 (\u0018947 \u2013 \u0018989) The arms \nrace between the Soviet Union and the \nUnited States was at play throughout the \nCold War, and many attribute the Soviet \nUnion\u2019s collapse to an inability to sustain \nthe final arms race instigated by Ronald \nReagan. This element of competition \nbetween the nations involved both nuclear \nand conventional weapons. Frequently, \nthere was an interplay between the two \nkinds of forces. During the early Cold \nWar, the United States (having rapidly \ndemobilized after World War II) had to rely on its nuclear weapons \nin a doctrine of \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d to counter Soviet preponder -\nance in conventional weapons. After the Soviets developed nuclear \nweapons of their own, both powers reverted to a system of flexible \nresponse. Underlying nuclear strategy throughout this later era was \nthe concept of mutually assured destruction. This reality made the \nlikelihood of direct superpower conventional warfare unlikely.

For \u00184 days in October \u0018962, the \ntwo superpowers seemed destined to \nclash directly about the Soviet emplace -\nment of Medium Range Ballistic Mis -\nsiles (MRBMs) and Intermediate Range \nBallistic Missiles (IRBMs) in Cuba. To \nprevent the installation of additional of -\nfensive weapons in Cuba, John F. Ken -\nnedy declared a naval quarantine around \nCuba. Tensions reached a near breaking point when a U-2 flight was \nshot down over Cuba, and Khruschev demanded US missiles be \nremoved from Turkey in exchange for Soviet missiles being removal \nfrom Cuba. Ultimately, Khrushchev was compelled to settle for a \nUS pledge not to invade Cuba, and a private agreement to resolve \nNATO\u2019s missile bases in Turkey. \nNUCLEAR SUBS  \u2014 (1955) The United States launched the first \nnuclear powered submarine. It instantly antiquated decades of anti-\nsubmarine warfare that had developed during the Second World \nWar. Admiral Hyman Rickover was to oversee the development of \na new nuclear navy, and create a third, and seemingly invulnerable \narm, in the American nuclear triad. Ultimately, the Soviets would follow suit. \nQUAGMIRE  \u2014 (\u0018964 \u2013 \u0018975) It is hard \nto put a precise date on when US involve -\nment in Vietnam ceased to be support for \nan anti-communist counter-insurgency \nand became instead an inextricable quag -\nmire. However, Congressional passage of \nthe Gulf of Tonkin resolution seems like \nas good a point as any. With hindsight, it \nis clear that the United States confused the \nvery nature of the conflict that they were \nfighting. Vietnam was fundamentally a \nwar of national liberation\u2014a struggle that \nhad begun centuries before against Chinese dominance, then French, \nthen Japanese and finally the United States. While the American \ngovernment may have never realized that they had fallen into the \nrole of \u201cforeign oppressor,\u201d that fact did not diminish Vietnamese \nresistance. Like most colonial wars, it came down to a calculus \nof cost. US interests were simply not worth the costs in national \nmorale, military manpower and economic resources that Vietnam \nwas consuming. But humbling a superpower is a long process, and \nso it was in Vietnam. \nSALT NEGOTIATIONS  \u2014 ( \u0018969, \u0018972) Initiated during the \nJohnson Administration, and completed by President Nixon and Sec -\nretary Brezhnev, the first Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT) \ntreaty essentially sought to limit the number of nuclear platforms, \nand restrict defensive systems that threatened the system of mutual \ndeterrence. The success of this treaty led to the initiation of a second \nround of negotiations or SALT II. The diplomatic wrangling over this treaty began under President Nixon, and was completed in \u0018979 by President Carter and Secretary Brezhnev. SALT II provided \nbroad limits on new strategic weapons platforms and banned mobile \nICBMs. Owing to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the treaty was \nnever ratified. President Reagan asserted that the Soviets were not complying with the terms of SALT II in \u0018986 and withdrew from \nthe treaty. \nBEAR TRAP  \u2014 (\u0018979 \u2013 \u0018992) In an era \nof seemingly increasing Soviet hubris, the \nUSSR reverted to old patterns of power \npolitics by meddling in the affairs of \nAfghanistan\u2014the battleground country \nin the \u201cGreat Game\u201d rivalry between \nimperialist Russia and Victorian Britain. \nThe Soviets considered Afghanistan \npart of their natural sphere of influence. \nHowever, when Soviet troops directly \nintervened in an Afghan power struggle \nand deposed the existing president, they \ngreatly miscalculated the reaction of world opinion.

As in an \ninternational boxing match, non-aligned countries watched from \nthe sidelines trying to discern which power was in the ascendant. \nVirtually all major arms control agreements were either initiated or \nconcluded at a summit. In that sense, they were an important tool \nfor sizing up relative intentions, and ensuring the Cold War did not \nbecome hot. \nHOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING  \u2014 (\u0018964) As the \nreality of nuclear holocaust became accepted by the public, fatalism \nabout its inevitability also took hold. The landmark black comedy, \nDr. Strangelove, captured this new mood. However, such attitudes \nare hardly unique. Similar fatalism about mankind\u2019s ultimate destiny \ncan be found throughout literature of the time and sparked a whole \nsub-genre of science fiction, the post-nuclear-holocaust dime novel \nfilled with atomic mutants and vague remnants of contemporary \ncivilization.

In Spanish, the term Junta means \u201ccoming \ntogether.\u201d In a Cold War context, it normally refers to the coming \ntogether of right wing military cliques to oust an existing government \nand replace it with a military dictatorship. Juntas were so common \nin Latin America throughout the period that they became a nearly \nritualized affair. More frequently than not, military juntas enjoyed \nthe tacit blessing of the U.S. government as they looked to check \nleftist elements in Central and South America.

What followed \nwas a sometimes playful, sometimes \npointed public exchange between Nixon \nand Nikita Khrushchev throughout his \nstay in Moscow. The exchange is known \nas the Kitchen Debate, for a particularly \nsharp exchange in front of a US model \nhome\u2019s display of a GE electric kitchen. \nNixon furthered his domestic political ambitions with a seeming jab \nat Khrushchev\u2019s chest, reaffirming his anti-communist credentials \nat home. \nMISSILE ENVY \u2014 (\u0018984) A term coined by Dr. Helen Caldicott, \nit reflects the general feminist critique that the Cold War was driven \nby male ego with very Freudian undercurrents. When one examines \nthe terminology of \u201cdeep penetration\u201d and \u201cmultiple reentry\u201d one \nwonders if she had a point. Caldicott went on to found Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility, and her book became a rallying point within \nthe anti-nuclear movement. \n\u201cWE WILL BURY YOU\u201d  \u2014 (\u0018956) Perhaps the most famous quote \nof the entire Cold War, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev uttered this \nimmortal line while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception \nin Moscow. With these words Khrushchev announced a period during \nwhich he would probe the West for weakness and opportunity. The \nBerlin Crisis exemplified this expansionist policy. \nBREZHNEV DOCTRINE  \u2014 (\u0018968) Announced to a crowd of \nPolish workers by Brezhnev himself, the Brezhnev Doctrine clarified \nthe de facto policy of the Soviet Union, the Prague Spring. Namely, \ncurrent socialist countries would not be allowed to abandon social -\nism or adopt a position of neutrality. The doctrine contributed to \nthe Soviets\u2019 miscalculation of world reaction to their invasion of \nAfghanistan. They looked upon the invasion as the mere application \nof this well-understood doctrine. \nPORTUGUESE EMPIRE CRUMBLES  \u2014 (\u0018974) Portugal was \nthe last European power to abandon her major colonial possessions \nin Africa. While admitted to NATO, Portugal was ruled by dictator -\nship under Antonio Salazar, who felt that colonial possessions would \npreserve Portugal\u2019s place in the community of nations. Nevertheless, \nthe repression of nationalist insurgencies brought criticism both \nfrom newly independent nations, as well as Portugal\u2019s NATO allies. \nFinally, with a democratic government in place, Portugal renounced \nits claims. Shortly thereafter, Portugal\u2019s former colonies of Angola \nand Mozambique descended into civil war and became major flash \npoints for East and West on the continent of Africa. \nSOUTH AFRICAN UNREST \u2014 (\u0018964 \u2013 \u0018994) The racist, mi -\nnority government of South Africa began to be challenged by the \nAfrican National Congress with Soviet and Cuban assistance from \nbases in Tanzania and Zambia and other \u201cfront-line\u201d states. The \nera of peaceful resistance formally ended with the massacres in \nSharpeville and Langa. For its part, South Africa sought to desta -\nbilize its neighbors, and undertook an invasion of Namibia, while \nalso supporting UNITA in Angola and FRELIMO in Mozambique. \nHowever, increasing black population, more powerful black trade \nunions, and hostility from other western nations eventually placed \nSouth Africa on the defensive. While the Reagan Administration \npursued a policy of \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with the Apartheid government, it remained a controversial proposition.

There he \nimplemented the same pragmatic approach to east-west linkages that \nhad characterized his mayorship of West Berlin. Termed Ostpolitik, \nunder Brandt, West Germany normalized relations with the Soviet \nUnion, Poland and Czechoslovakia. While not abandoning the no -\ntion of German reunification, he acknowledged the inviolability \nof existing borders and went on to normalize relations with East \nGermany. Ultimately, his government was brought down by an \ninternal spy scandal. \nMUSLIM REVOLUTION \u2014 (\u0018979) As \nsecular Arab and Muslim states through -\nout the Middle East displayed corruption, \nrepression and incompetence, more \nradical forms of Islam began to come \nto the fore. The Muslim Brotherhood, \nfounded in Egypt, sought to topple the \nsecular regime there and in Syria. This \nled to further cycles of repression and \nauthoritarian rule within these coun -\ntries. A similar cycle took place in Iran \nunder Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. \nA long standing regional ally of the United States, and the West \ngenerally, the Shah was deposed by a popular revolution led by the \nanti-western Ayatollah Khomeini. This ushered in the world\u2019s first \ncontemporary theocracy. Iran\u2019s Mullahs would spend the rest of \nthe 20th Century in efforts to export their revolution to other Shia \nMuslim communities. \nABM TREATY  \u2014 ( \u0018972) The Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty \nsought to cement the system of mutually assured destruction as \nthe lynchpin of strategic balance. The ABM treaty restricted the \nability of the two superpowers to defend themselves from nuclear \nstrike. In theory, this made a first strike to prevent the introduction \nof destabilizing defensive systems unnecessary. Both nations were \nallowed to defend either their capital or one field of ICBMs with a \nmissile defense system. The Soviets deployed such a system around \nMoscow. Ultimately, the US abandoned its system deployed in Grand \nForks, North Dakota. \nCULTURAL REVOLUTION  \u2014 (\u0018966 \u2013 \u0018977) While primarily \nrepresentative of an internal power struggle within the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, the Cultural Revolution had profound interna -\ntional implications.

The \nsuccessful downing of the U-2 caused a major chill in superpower \nrelations and was a propaganda coup for the Soviet Union. \nOPEC  \u2014 ( \u0018960) Founded to allow oil \nproducing countries to have more control \nover the price of oil, and thereby state rev -\nenues, OPEC has grown into an institution \nthat controls two-thirds of the world\u2019s oil \nreserves and generates roughly half of the \nworld\u2019s oil exports. The creation of OPEC \nwas a major blow to the control of the \nglobal oil market by the Western giants like \nExxon and British Petroleum. While OPEC \ndoes include non-Middle Eastern countries \nsuch as Venezuela, Indonesia and Nigeria, \nit is heavily dominated by countries from that region. As a result, \nOPEC has intervened in the political crises there. Most famously, \nOPEC refused oil exports to Western countries supporting Israel in \nthe Yom Kippur (or October) War. This resulted in a 400% increase \nin oil prices and required rationing in the West.\n\u201cLONE GUNMAN\u201d  \u2014 (\u0018963) While campaigning in Dallas, Texas, \nPresident John F. Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald. \nTwo commissions, the Warren Commission, and the House Select \nCommittee on Assassinations, differed over whether or not Oswald \nacted alone. In any case, the circumstances of the President\u2019s death \nthrew the country into a panic and created ample opportunity for \nconspiracy theories ranging from the Mafia, the Cuban government, \nthe KGB and America\u2019s own CIA. It also marked the beginning of \na string of high profile political assassinations in the United States \nthat would include Dr. Martin Luther King and John Kennedy\u2019s \nbrother (and Democratic Presidential candidate) Robert Kennedy. \nThese untimely deaths shook American confidence and added to the \nmalaise of the Vietnam era.

The Canal was a vital strategic link for the \nUnited States navy both during the First and Second World Wars. \nHowever, by the time of the Korean War, the canal was no longer \nlarge enough to accommodate contemporary warships. With its \nutility to the U.S. military greatly diminished, while its propaganda \nvalue as a relic of American imperialism still on the rise, Carter \nrealized that gradual hand-over of the canal was the best policy alternative. \nCAMP DA VID ACCORDS \u2014 (\u0018978) \nFollowing a lull in the Middle East peace process caused by the \u0018976 presidential \nelections, President Carter entered office \nwith a burst of new energy on the subject. \nThrough direct personal appeal, Carter \nwas able to bring ultimate resolution \nto the Yom Kippur War and completely \nchange the dynamic of the Middle East -\nern question. Israel and Egypt normalized \nrelations and a framework for Middle \nEast peace was agreed to. Years later, this \nwould allow for the Oslo accord, and the Jordanian\u2013Israeli Peace \nAgreement. Additionally, Carter also secured the complete realign -\nment of Egypt. Once a Nasser led hotbed of anti-Western feeling, \nEgypt was to become one of America\u2019s foremost allies in the region. \nSadat would pay dearly for the leadership he showed during the talks. He was assassinated by Islamic radicals in \u001898\u0018. \nPUPPET GOVERNMENTS  \u2014 (\u0018949 \u2013 ?) Not a concept unique \nto the Cold War, the term \u201cpuppet governments\u201d refers to a regime \nthat holds power due to, and with the support of, either the Soviet \nUnion or the United States. A derisive term, it is almost always \nused by the opponents of a state to undermine the government\u2019s \nlegitimacy. Both the Soviets and the Americans would apply the \nterm to any closely allied state, but it might be better understood in \nthe context of the Diem government in South Vietnam or Mariam \ngovernment of Ethiopia. \nGRAIN SALES TO SOVIETS  \u2014 (\u0018973 \u2013 \u0018980, \u001898\u0018 \u2013 ?) In \u0018973, \ndifficult climatic circumstances and dramatic crop failures prompted \nPresident Nixon to allow for massive grain sales to the Soviet Union. \nWhile a blow to Russian pride, the program was nevertheless a step \ntowards normalized relations between the superpowers.

In \u0018980, \nPresident Carter suspended the program in retaliation for the Soviet \ninvasion of Afghanistan. Shipments were resumed a year later under \nPresident Reagan. This culminated in a treaty with the Soviets, with \nthe Soviets promising to buy 9 million tons of US grains per year. \nJOHN PAUL II ELECTED POPE  \u2014 (1978) The first non-Italian \nto be elected Pope since the \u00186th Century, Pope John Paul II repre -\nsented a rejuvenation of Catholic influence upon the world stage. \nThe United States gave formal diplomatic recognition to the Papacy \nfor the first time in its history. As a Pope elected from communist \nPoland, John Paul II presented an enormous challenge for Poland\u2019s \nleadership. To criticize the new papacy would only alienate the \npublic, to embrace it would be antithetical to communist doctrine. \nFurthermore, John Paul II was known to be an ardent critic of com -\nmunism. John Paul\u2019s election marked a turning point in internal \nPolish political dynamics that would culminate in the Solidarity \nmovement. Mikhail Gorbachev remarked that the fall of the iron \ncurtain would have been impossible without John Paul II.\nLATIN AMERICAN DEATH SQUADS  \u2014 ( \u0018960 \u2013 \u0018989) \nThroughout the Cold War, both left and rightwing governments \nsupported reactionary regimes that resorted to disproportionate \nforce when reacting to threats to that government. While this was \na particular penchant of rightwing governments in Latin America, \nleftist governments also proved their deft use of brutality. El Salva -\ndor, Guatemala, and Columbia remain the most harrowing examples \nof the practice of government sponsored murder. President Osorio \nof Guatemala once infamously remarked \u201cIf it is necessary to turn \nthe country into a graveyard in order to pacify it, I will not hesitate \nto do so.\u201d \nOAS FOUNDED \u2014 ( \u0018948, \u0018967) \nFounded with the specific aim of promot -\ning democracy in the western hemisphere, \nthe OAS has been an occasionally useful \nbody for the promotion of US interests \nwithin the hemisphere. It provided inter -\nnational legitimacy for US actions during \nboth the Cuban Missile Crisis and the US \ninvasion of Grenada. Trade promotion \nand economic development were added \nto the OAS charter in Buenos Aires in \n\u0018967. The revision of the charter also \nestablished the existence of permanent OAS diplomatic venues with \nthe creation of a General Assembly in Washington, DC.\nNIXON PLAYS THE CHINA CARD  \u2014 (\u0018972) Realizing that \nnormalization of relations with China was key for US withdrawal \nfrom South Vietnam, Nixon sought a summit between himself and \nMao. Nixon dispatched Henry Kissinger to secret talks with the \nPRC\u2019s foreign minister Chou En-lai to lay the groundwork for the \nvisit. Capitalizing on deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations, Nixon \nscored perhaps the greatest diplomatic coup of the Cold War. The \nShanghai Communique that followed the summit danced around \nseveral fundamental disagreements between the two countries, in -\ncluding Taiwan and Vietnam. However, it was clear that the Soviet \nUnion could no longer depend upon Chinese support in regional \nconflicts. While Nixon expressed his desire to fully normalize re -\nlations between the two countries quickly, Watergate interrupted \nthese plans. It would fall to Jimmy Carter to restore full diplomatic relations between the two countries. SADAT EXPELS SOVIETS  \u2014 (\u0018972) Anwar Sadat was an early \nparticipant in anti-colonial activities against the British-sponsored \nEgyptian monarchy. He became vice president under Nasser, and \ninherited a deteriorating relationship with the USSR when he \ntransitioned into the presidency. The Soviets refused Egyptian de -\nmands for increased economic and military aid, and the Egyptians \nwere trying hard to keep a foot in both camps. In reaction, Sadat expelled the 5,000 Soviet military advisors and \u00185,000 air force \npersonnel in Egypt. After the brokered Mideast peace following \u0018973 war, Sadat became convinced of the need for closer relations \nwith Washington. \nSHUTTLE DIPLOMACY  \u2014 ( \u0018973) Personalized diplomacy \nthat uses advances in transportation and communications, Shuttle \nDiplomacy was a hallmark of Henry Kissinger\u2019s term as Secretary of \nState.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4312, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "761ce1e6-2995-4856-a999-0b4d776ef67d": {"__data__": {"id_": "761ce1e6-2995-4856-a999-0b4d776ef67d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81b3a605-6bf3-4170-bf8a-e5550d31f1fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "867f6677edd3820ef528e302fc49e7471aa58a2f9c0decd1503c47813934b18f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "346c5165-bc82-4f30-97ee-4b47788e4322", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "0bc8630131bec2d171435293f8479a47c6421772dc7830434ec52a6b24b7924c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a875be3b-6250-4ba7-8289-eb7959242e2e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa32627e467c6664445237a56ca0a04b3a96aa9e7be9a0de8e408674fc3e7cd3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He became vice president under Nasser, and \ninherited a deteriorating relationship with the USSR when he \ntransitioned into the presidency.

An outgrowth of the \nSecond Vatican Council, liberation theology stresses Jesus Christ \nas liberator. The theological strain that sustained this outlook origi -\nnated in Latin America and flourished there, particularly with the \nJesuit order. While never embraced by Pope John Paul II due to its \nMarxist undercurrents, liberation theology remains very popular \nwith individual priests and the laity in the third world. Its emphasis \non social justice and its critique of capitalist excess has, however, \nbeen incorporated into broader Church doctrine. \nUSSURI RIVER SKIRMISH  \u2014 (\u0018969) After years of deteriorat -\ning relations and China\u2019s first nuclear test, forces of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and the Soviet Union clashed along their long and \nporous border. The Ussuri and Amur Rivers\u2019 possession remained \nuncertain between the two nations and were a source of friction. \nFollowing a military buildup on both sides of the border, tensions \nspilled over into a several sharp skirmishes.

Emphases \nfor the program included land reform, democratic reform and \ntax reform. By the late 60\u2019s the United States had become fully \nembroiled in Vietnam and South Asia, thus aid for Latin America \nwaned. Furthermore, few Latin American countries proved willing \nto undertake the required reforms. As a result, the Organization of \nAmerican States disbanded its \u201cpermanent\u201d Alliance for Progress \nCommittee in \u0018973. \nAFRICA SCORING  \u2014 African history throughout the Cold War \nreflects the promise and tragedy that go hand in hand with that \ncontinent\u2019s experience. At first buoyed by the political success of \nrapid decolonization, the jubilation would devolve into cynicism. \nOne after another, newly independent governments would give way \nto \u201cpresidents for life,\u201d political corruption, economic chaos and \nethnic violence. Lacking resources, African governments quickly \ntook advantage of the superpower rivalry to maximize economic \nand military support for their regimes. In the post-colonial era, a \nvariety of proxy civil wars were fought on the continent. Angola, \nMozambique, Chad and Ethiopia were but a few of the nations that \nexperienced violence theoretically in the name of the global struggle between communism and capitalism.   \n\u201cONE SMALL STEP . . .\u201d  \u2014 ( \u001896\u0018 \n\u2013 \u0018969) After years of lagging behind So -\nviet space exploits, the United States put \nits full intellectual and economic weight \nbehind the \u201crace to the moon\u201d. President \nKennedy initiated Project Mercury. Ul -\ntimately, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration would overcome \nenormous technological hurdles to place a \nman on the moon. As Neil Armstrong, the \nfirst human to set foot upon the moon\u2019s \nsurface, descended from the space craft, \nhe uttered the immortal line \u201cone small \nstep for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d In so doing, he con -\nfirmed an American come-back victory in the space race between \nthe superpowers.\nSOLIDARITY  \u2014 (\u0018980 \u2013 ?) A trade union movement originating \nin the Polish shipyards of Gdansk, Solidarity became the focal point \nfor anti-communist resistance within the Eastern bloc. Solidarity \nquickly moved beyond a simple worker\u2019s movement and rallied \npro-Catholic, intellectuals and other social dissidents to its banner. \nIts toleration within a Warsaw Pact nation was unprecedented, and \ninvolved a cat and mouse game heavily reliant on public scrutiny of \nSoviet intentions, the prestige of the Polish Pope, John Paul II, and \nthe political courage of its leader Lech Walesa. While Poland\u2019s com -\nmunist led government under Wojciech Jaruzelski did crack down on \nSolidarity and imprison much of its leadership, the organization went underground and began to regrow.

An ardent anti-communist, Thatcher received the moniker \n\u201cIron Lady\u201d from the Soviet newspaper, \u201cThe Red Star.\u201d Thatcher \nprovided the perfect partner for Ronald Reagan, and together, they \nrenewed the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that formed the lynchpin of the \npost-war Atlantic Alliance. Thatcher\u2019s finest moment may have been \nher vigorous defense of Britain\u2019s colonial outpost in the Falkland \nIslands. The military junta ruling Argentina launched an invasion \nof what they referred to as the Malvinas Islands. In a sharp, short \nmilitary action, the UK expelled the Argentinian forces, and restored \nsome small luster to Britain\u2019s former imperial pretensions. Thatcher \nreigned through the close of the Cold War, and is Britain\u2019s longest \nserving prime minister. \nREAGAN BOMBS LIBYA  \u2014 ( \u0018986) After the fall of Nasser, \na petro-dollar empowered strongman, Muamar Qaddafi, sought \nLibya\u2019s day in the sun as leader of the Arab world. To prove his \nbona-fides Qaddafi became the leading source for state supported \nterrorism against the west. As Iran provided a new model for anti-\nwestern resistance, Qaddafi took on an increasingly religious piety \nin his defamations of the West. Following earlier show-downs \ninvolving the Gulf of Sidra, the United States took swift retribution \nfor Libya\u2019s apparent involvement in a West German discotheque \nbombing that killed an American serviceman. Targeting was heavily \nfocused on killing Qadaffi, and his personal residences were targeted. \nWhile he escaped death, Qadaffi\u2019s international prestige was much tarnished. \nSTAR WARS  \u2014 (\u0018983 \u2013 ?) More properly known as the Strategic \nDefense Initiative, President Reagan announced this radical depar -\nture from the Cold War doctrine of \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d in \na live television speech to the American public. The initial concept \nfor the \u201cspace shield\u201d was developed at Lawrence Livermore Na -\ntional Laboratory by Dr. Peter Hagelstein. Notionally, it would create \na series of space based satellites powered by nuclear reactors that \nwould create an impenetrable field to block Soviet ICBM\u2019s.

His experience within the Politburo \ngave him broad exposure to the West \nwhich profoundly affected his thinking \nabout the USSR\u2019s future. \u201cGorby,\u201d as he \nwould be known in the West, inspired a \nsort of fan following. Margaret Thatcher \nfamously remarked on his coming to \npower \u201cI like Mr. Gorbachev\u2014we can \ndo business together.\u201d Ultimately, Gorbachev would oversee the \ndismantling of the Soviet bloc. While his reformist agenda, includ -\ning Perestroika (economic reform) and Glasnost (political freedom) \nmade him extremely popular in the West, it made him less so in the \nSoviet Union. Ultimately, Gorbachev would be removed from office as the result of a reactionary military coup in \u001899\u0018. In the wake of \nits failure, the Russian Federation would turn to a newly minted \nhero, Boris Yeltsin. \nMARINE BARRACKS BOMBING  \u2014 (\u0018983) After the Israeli \ninvasion of Lebanon, the United States and France dispatched troops \nto form a peace keeping force between the opposing sides. Terror -\nist attacks on the troop barracks of both nations resulted in terrible losses. 24\u0018 US servicemen and 58 French paratroopers were killed \nin the attacks. It was the worst single day of casualties suffered by \nthe US Marine Corps since Iwo Jima. While US suspicions have \nfocused on Iranian sponsored Hezbollah terrorists, precise respon -\nsibility remains unknown. \nSOVIETS SHOOT DOWN KAL-007  \u2014 (\u0018983) Flying from New \nYork City, to Seoul, South Korea, the doomed Korean Airlines Flight \n007 strayed into Soviet Airspace due to a navigational error involving \nthe plane\u2019s autopilot system. While the Soviets contemporaneously \nclaimed that they did not know that plane was civilian, tape releases \nafter the Cold War indicate that little if any warning was given to the \nairliner. The Reagan administration rallied global reaction against the \nSoviets\u2014even playing decoded messages before the UN Security \nCouncil. 269 passengers and crew were killed during the attack, including one member of Congress. \nGLASNOST  \u2014 (\u0018985 \u2013 \u0018989) The Russian word for openness, \nGlasnost was introduced as a public policy by Mikhail Gorbachev. \nWhile his long term aim may have been to improve the freedoms \nof the Russian people, his more immediate goal was to increase \npressure on conservative apparatchiks to accept his \u201cperestroika\u201d \neconomic reforms.

While a \nthreat as old as human civilization, the use \nof terrorism as an instrument to change \ninternational policy ebbed and flowed \nthroughout the Cold War. The Soviet \nUnion and its Warsaw Pact allies were \nknown to train terrorist organizations \nwithin their borders, including radical \nelements of the Palestinian Liberation \nOrganization (PLO). In many ways, the \nPLO provided the archetype for a terrorist \norganization throughout the Cold War. \nWith its anti-Western, anti-Israel ideology, it became a cause celebre \nfor those asserting that the West was on a neo-imperialist crusade in \nthe third world. Palestinian terrorists hijacked planes, attacked the Achille Lauro, and perhaps most infamously murdered \u0018\u0018 Israeli \nathletes at the Munich Olympics in \u0018972. There were also western \nbased, communist affiliated terrorists such as the Red Brigades in \nItaly, and the Red Army in Japan.

Compound -\ning this difficulty was the fact that the \nproceeds from weapons sales to Iran were \nused to covertly fund the Contra guerillas \nin Nicaragua. This was in contravention \nof stated Administration policy, as well as \nlaws adopted by the Democrat-controlled Congress. Colonel Oliver \nNorth and Admiral John Poindexter both were criminally indicted \nfor the scandal, though the Congressional report concluded that President Reagan bore ultimate responsibility for the scandal. \nCHERNOBYL  \u2014 (\u0018986) The Chernobyl accident was the worst \ndisaster in the history of nuclear power.

Reagan, with the Brandenburg gate in the background, \ndeclared: \u201cGeneral Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you \nseek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek \nliberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this \ngate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d While provocative, the \nspeech leveled a difficult criticism at the Soviet Union. Successful \ncountries do not have to wall their citizens in. Two short years later, \nthe Berlin Wall would come down. \n\u201cAN EVIL EMPIRE\u201d  \u2014 (\u0018983) First used by President Ronald \nReagan before the National Association of Evangelicals, conserva -\ntives applied the term \u201cevil empire\u201d to the Soviet Union. This change \nin terminology encapsulated the conservative movement\u2019s rejection \nof Nixon\u2019s morally ambiguous policy of detente. The speech sparked \ncontroversy within the NATO alliance, as many European leaders \nfound the speech unnecessarily provocative. Domestically, the left \nargued that the United States had no room to criticize Soviet actions \nduring the Cold War, and pointed to CIA involvement in places like \nChile. The speech gave further indication that the last phase of the \nCold War would be a confrontational one. \nALDRICH AMES  \u2014 (1985 \u2013 1994) The first known successful \npenetration of the CIA by the KGB, Aldrich Ames compromised \nhundreds of CIA operations and provided information that resulted in the execution of \u00180 US sources. The CIA spent years looking for \nanother explanation for the leaks\u2014in particular the possibility that \nthe KGB had bugged CIA headquarters. Ames\u2019 motivation was not \nideological, and he and his wife enjoyed the extravagance that his \n$2.5 million in bribes provided. Ames first walked into the Soviet embassy in \u0018995. At that time, he oversaw the analysis of Soviet \nintelligence operations in Europe. \nPERSHING II DEPLOYED  \u2014 (\u0018984 \u2013 \u0018985) The Pershing II \nmissile was designed as a direct counter to the Soviet Intermediate Range Missile, the SS-20. The deployment of \u001808 of these missiles \nin West Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom proved a major test \nfor NATO\u2019s resolve. Public protests against the deployments were \nmassive. However, despite the strains, the weapons were deployed, \nproviding NATO with a bargaining chip in the proposed Intermediate \nrange Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty discussions. These negotiations had been suspended in \u0018983, and the successful deployment of \nthe Pershing II\u2019s provided impetus for restarting the talks in \u0018985. \nUltimately, the talks would succeed at the Reykjavik summit in Iceland in \u0018986. WARGAMES  \u2014 (\u0018956 \u2013 \u0018995) Brinksmanship was a term coined \nby John Foster Dulles to describe a policy of coming close to war, \nwithout falling into the abyss. At different times, during different \ncrises, this policy was pursued by both superpowers.

At different times, during different \ncrises, this policy was pursued by both superpowers. However, there \nwas always the danger that brinksmanship could turn the \u201ccold\u201d \nwar, hot. Additionally, brinksmanship encouraged a nuclear posture \nof \u201claunch on warning.\u201d Game theory demanded that if your op -\nponent were launching a massive nuclear strike, you would have to \nlaunch your own weapons before they could be destroyed in their \nsilos. These doctrines shortened reaction times of world leaders from hours to minutes. On November 9th, \u0018979, the United States \nmade preparations for a retaliatory nuclear strike when a NORAD \ncomputer glitch indicated an all-out Soviet strike had been launched. \nAs recently as 1995, Russia mistook a Norwegian scientific missile \nlaunch for an attack, and Boris Yeltsin was asked to decide whether \nor not to counterattack. \nFORMOSAN RESOLUTION \u2014 (\u0018955) Reacting to the \u201closs of \nChina\u201d the United States Congress extended to President Eisenhower \nopen ended authority to defend Taiwan\u2014technically known as the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan\u2014with military force. The resolution \ncame at a time when the United States faced challenges from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic in Indochina as well as the Korean peninsula. Ef -\nfectively, Taiwan sat under the US nuclear umbrella, and the balance \nof power within the Taiwan Straits would now remain a question of \nstrategic importance to the United States. \nIRAN-IRAQ WAR  \u2014 ( \u0018980 \u2013 \u0018988) \nCommenting on the war, Henry Kissinger \nfamously remarked, \u201cToo bad they can\u2019t \nboth lose.\u201d Sparked by simmering land \ndisputes over the Shatt al-Arab, Saddam \nHussein sought to establish Iraq as a \ntrue regional power, and also check the \nexport of Shia fundamentalism from Iran. \nInitially, Iraq scored limited gains, but \nIranian forces rallied and began a counter \noffensive into Iraq. Without set allies in \nthe conflict, the United States played a \ncynical game of attempting to keep both \nsides sufficiently supplied for the war to continue. Ultimately, the \nUS began to tilt to Iraq as an Iranian victory in the war would have \nbeen an unacceptable outcome. Iran also utilized oil as a weapon \nnecessitating the US flagging of Kuwaiti tankers to ensure oil sup -\nplies. After 8 years of war, the border returned to its ante bellum \nstatus.

Twilight Struggle,  more than anything else, \nis a game designed to meet our needs. We are both huge fans of \nthe card driven wargame, and how it has breathed new life into \nwargaming in general. Like a modern day Lazarus, card driven \nwargames have brought our hobby back from the grave. Yet even \nfive years ago, when Ananda and I first decided we wanted to \ntry our hand at design, the writing was on the wall. Card driven \ngames were going to become less and less like We The People,  and \nHannibal,  and more and more like Paths of Glory  and Barbarossa \nto Berlin.  That is not a critique of Mr. Raicer\u2019s work. In fact, we \nthink that it took Paths of Glory  to demonstrate just how rich a card \ndriven game might be. But it conflicted with another reality. We \nwere getting older. Our lives were less like the gaming rich days \nof college, and more like the work-a-day world of the \u201cnuclear\u201d \nfamily. Eight hours for a single game was becoming less and less \nlikely. So selfishly, we designed a game to fit our schedules. You \ncan play Twilight Struggle  from beginning to end in the same time \nit takes to play the \u201cshort\u201d scenario of many other games. Heck, \nyou can switch sides and play the Cold War from both angles if you \nare really ambitious. That is a long way of saying the number one \nconstraint on the design was time. \nThe second question that we had to answer was the subject area. \nI believe that civil wars are the perfect subject for the influence \nsystem. So initially, I convinced Ananda to try a Spanish Civil \nWar design. A couple of books on the subject quickly convinced \nus that it would takes years to master the politics of that war, and \nfrankly, we weren\u2019t going to wait years to start. So Ananda, in a \nstroke of genius, suggested the Cold War as a replacement. It was \na great topic. There are very few games that deal with the politi -\ncal aspects of the Cold War in a serious way\u2014there were not that \nmany of them even when we were fighting the Cold War. The basic \ninfluence system translated well. The history was a non issue, for \nas an International Relations major in the \u0018980\u2019s, I basically spent \nfour years studying the Cold War. Finally, one of the best gam -\ning experiences that I ever had was Chris Crawford\u2019s Balance of \nPower.  It was a game about Cold War politics, and even more so, \nabout the brinksmanship of a crisis between the superpowers. To \nthis day, computer gamers look back on its innovation. I\u2019ll never \nforget the game\u2019s immortal line when you brought the world to \nnuclear destruction over something ridiculous like funding gueril -\nlas in Kenya. \n You have ignited a nuclear war. And no, there is no animated \ndisplay or a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through \nthe air. We do not reward failure. \nHad I failed my senior year of high school, it really would have \nbeen Chris Crawford\u2019s fault. So, Ananda\u2019s golden idea provided us \nthe chance to try and recreate some of the magic of that game. \nWe use the term \u201cgame\u201d advisedly. Twilight Struggle  does not \nreach beyond its means. Wherever there were compromises to \nmake between realism and playability, we sided with playability. \nWe want to evoke the feel of the Cold War, we hope people get a \nfew insights they didn\u2019t possess, but we have no pretensions that \na game of this scope or length could pretend to be a simulation. \nAlso important for players to understand is that the game has a very definite point of view. Twilight Struggle  basically accepts all \nof the internal logic of the Cold War as true\u2014even those parts of it \nthat are demonstrably false. Therefore, the only relationships that \nmatter in this game are those between a nation and the superpowers. \nThe world provides a convenient chess board for US and Soviet \nambitions, but all other nations are mere pawns (with perhaps the \noccasional bishop) in that game.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4056, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28799eb7-4a03-4ef1-9b83-60f48a7487c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "28799eb7-4a03-4ef1-9b83-60f48a7487c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3dbf02ab-e3e5-4f13-8ed6-62713d4c3464", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "9b86c70851bfc717aae6b4262e4a703ad1159e21df50f3dafbff6b38b921092e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "94733286-a4e9-49ed-9add-e479472ebb14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\TS_Rules_Deluxe.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1656414, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "6907391ae09d9e50a5bdd6b0d5ceff7dea6f0bae0f7810d19ffc1c140a0bf423", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3833e257-7ead-4650-8edf-5e0dbd508e02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "507a27ed29472b2caa5254e432c20f6ceb79ab3ee1a235175286447435642028", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Twilight Struggle  does not \nreach beyond its means.

Even China is abstracted down to \na card that is passed between the two countries. Furthermore, not \nonly does the domino theory work, it is a prerequisite for extend -\ning influence into a region. Historians would rightly dispute all \nof these assumptions, but in keeping with the design philosophy, \nwe think they make a better game. \nOne very notable difference between Twilight Struggle  and other \nCold War games is that we assume nuclear war would be a bad \nthing. Many other designs make the whole idea of letting the \nnuclear genie out the bottle irresistible. From our vantage point \nof hindsight, nuclear war was unthinkable, and that is why it did \nnot happen. Yes, we came close, but we believe that rational actors \nwould veer away from the button. Once the button was pushed, \nnuclear war would have taken on a grim logic of its own, and hu -\nman extinction might have been the result. \nThere were many decisions made for playability, but we will touch \nupon two. First, not all countries that are geographically adjacent \nare connected to one another. There are three reasons for this. For \ninstance, many countries are amalgamations, so that messes with \ngeography from the get go. Secondly, and most importantly, we \nwanted there to be a real impact to the domino theory, with play -\ners spreading their influence slowly across the map. Think of the \nold documentaries with red animated arrows streaming from the \nSoviet Union in all directions. Finally, and most rarely, the lack \nof a connection between countries reflects the local antagonisms \nbetween two presumed allies. \nThe second decision that warrants a bit more elaboration is what \nnations were labeled \u201cbattleground state.\u201d Basically, there were \nthree ways to attain this status. First, recognized regional pow -\ners got it. The South American battlegrounds reflect this well. \nSecondly, if a nation possessed important strategic resources, that \nalso meant battleground status. Obviously, most battlegrounds in \nthe Middle East, as well as Angola and Venezuela, would qualify \nhere. Finally, if a nation was an actual battleground between the \nsuperpowers, like South Korea, it received battleground status. So, \nfor our English and Australian cousins, please know that we are not \nranking you behind our French allies. Instead, you are anchors of \nUS influence in Europe and Asia at the start of the game. \nThere are many aspects of the game about which we are proud, but \nthe most amusing is how the game can capture the psychology of \nthe Cold War. Areas become important just because your opponent \nthinks they are important\u2014he must be going there for some reason! \nAlso, we are proud of the interaction of the DEFCON chart with \nmilitary operations. It really compels each turn to have a diversity \nof actions that makes for a more tense and exciting game. \nAt the end of the day, Twilight Struggle  represents a bit of \nCold War nostalgia. In a world of stateless enemies, for whom \nour destruction is an end in itself, the Cold War seems a quaint \ndisagreement about economics. As religious chauvinism shoves \naside ideology, we yearn for a simpler time absent of invisible \nmenaces, fighting for cherished principle against an enemy that \nwe understood.

Place them side by \nside (field side up) on the vineyard \nmat. Shuffle the 4 decks of small cards \n(green, yellow, purple, and blue) and \nplace them on the board. \nDeck Maintenance:  If any of the \nfour decks are exhausted during play, \nimmediately shuffle the discard pile \nand replace the deck. If the deck has \nbeen exhausted but no cards have been \ndiscarded, that deck is unavailable until \nmore cards are discarded.\nFirst Player: Take all of the rooster \ntokens that have been claimed by \nplayers, shake them up in your hand, and \nrandomly pick one. The player with that \ncolor is the first player and gets the first \nplayer token (\n ). \nExample  \nYou are dealt the following red and blue cards:\nThus you will begin the game with 2 regular workers, 1 vine card, 1 summer \nvisitor card, 1 wine order card, \n , 1 grande worker, and either a windmill or \nan additional \nRed and Blue Cards:  After randomly \nselecting the first player, shuffle the \nred cards and deal one face-up to each \nplayer; do the same for the blue cards. \nThese cards determine each player's \nstarting resources.\nAdvanced Variant:  Some groups \nmight prefer to let each player draw  \n2 red cards and 2 blue cards, then \nchoose 1 of each.\nEvery red card comes with 2 regular \nworkers. Draw cards as indicated on \nyour red card to form your opening \nhand. Do this before gaining resources \nfrom your blue card.\nEvery blue card comes with 1 grande \nworker, and most come with a certain \namount of lira. Blue cards also give you \na choice: start with a specific structure \nor gain a few extra lira. Players make \nthis choice in clockwise order starting \nwith the first player. Several blue cards \noffer an extra regular worker or a victory \npoint instead of a structure.After all starting resources are \naccounted for, discard the red and blue \ncards.

The 1-value red grape becomes a 1-value red wine, and the \n4-value red grape is devalued to become a 3-value red wine.\nExample 2:  The player decides to make a blush wine token, so they combine a \nred and a white grape to form a single blush wine token equal to their cumulative \nvalue. They can only do this because they own a medium cellar.Make Up to 2 Wine Tokens:  Players \nmake wine by converting grapes on \ntheir crush pads into wine tokens. Low-\nvalue red and white wine tokens can be \ncreated when a player owns only a small \ncellar, but the cellar must be upgraded \nto create blush wine, sparkling wine, \nand higher-value red and white wine. \nWhen a player makes more than 1 wine \ntoken, the wine they make may be the \nsame type of wine or different types.Red Wine:  Move 1 red grape token \nto the corresponding space on the \ncellar. For example, a 3-value red grape \nbecomes a 3-value red wine. \nWhite Wine:  Move 1 white grape \ntoken to the corresponding space on \nthe cellar.\nImportant: You may NOT combine \nmultiple red grape tokens to make \na single red wine token, nor can you \ncombine multiple white grape tokens to \ncreate a single white wine token.Blush:  Combine 1 red grape token \nand 1 white grape token to make \n1 blush wine token equal to the \ncombined values of the grapes. For \nexample, a 1-value white grape plus \na 4-value red grape creates a 5-value \nblush wine (see example 2).\nSparkling: Combine 2 red grape \ntokens and 1 white grape token to \nmake 1 sparkling wine token equal to \nthe grape value.makinG  WinE\nVitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.indd   15VitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.indd   15 1/10/22   9:56 PM1/10/22   9:56 PM", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2309, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09a5798c-5a13-4148-a979-9df0623203ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "09a5798c-5a13-4148-a979-9df0623203ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "VitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\VitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 36850600, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4f9f7f4b-87a3-4342-b74f-699bd2ae4100", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "VitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\VitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 36850600, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "14e0230c2384827d233096dd8fc26f9200a7a34e35bba4caa8633be178cfdf56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f2ac248-0a80-41ca-bb98-5e4ef35205bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "VitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\projects\\learn-llama-index\\pdf-parser\\data\\VitiRulebook_EssEd_2nd_r14.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 36850600, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "256801e1d1413abaa68bde0c1b1ba98229844487047f266ed7a8603666d7ced6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fcfe7eb5-9f66-488f-a997-d85e3346d110", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd78c942fdd36171d530349f3bedf099177cb6682d4063c46f589cb9921f9a16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "16Example: Filling a Wine Order  \nThis wine order card requires a red wine token worth at least 2 and a white wine worth at least 4.

Remove the glass \ntoken and place it to the side of your player \nmat. This becomes a bonus action token.\nNote:  The \"Organizer\" summer visitor \ncard action can not move your rooster \nto row 7.GamEplay\nThe game plays out season by season \nusing the 2-player action spaces (the \nfar-left space on each action).\nAutoma Cards  \nAt the beginning of each season where you \nare to place workers, first draw 1 Automa \ncard from the deck. Then place either 0, 1, \n2, or 3 Automa workers on action spaces \non the board in the current season as \nindicated on the Automa card. To maintain \ncompatibility with the extended board \nfrom the Tuscany expansion, Automa \ncards have the four seasonal colors. In \nViticulture, yellow and green correspond to \nsummer and red and blue correspond to \nwinter. Additionally, some actions are \nspecific to expansions from Tuscany. These \nare marked with a \"T\" on the Automa card \nand they should be ignored if you're not \nusing the corresponding expansion.\nAutoma workers do not actually take \nany actions, nor do they gain bonuses. \nThey simply block action spaces to \nsimulate an opponent.Bonus Action Tokens  \nWhenever you choose your wake-up slot \nat the beginning of the year, remove the \nglass token from the slot and place it to \nthe side of your vineyard mat. You may \naccumulate these Bonus Action Tokens \nfrom year to year. You may spend 1 of \nthose tokens per turn when you place 1 \nof your workers on the board. Discard a \nBonus Action Token and in addition to \ntaking the action, also gain the bonus \naction of that action. If you do, you may \ntake the action and the bonus in any order.\nExample  \nIf you draw this card during summer place Automa workers on the \n\"Draw \n \", \"Build one structure\", and \"Plant  \n \" actions in that order (the \norder only matters at the hard and very hard difficulties).

Workers can \nonly be placed in the current season, and \neach worker can only be placed once a \nyear. Some action spaces are private\u2014\nthey are on your player mats or on \nstructures you\u2019ve built. Only you can place \nworkers on your private action spaces.\nAge Grapes & Wine: Increase the \nvalue of all grape tokens on your crush \npad and wine tokens in your cellar. Wine \ntokens cannot advance into cellars that you \nhaven\u2019t built.\nBonus:  An extra benefit indicated inside \nan action space. You may place a worker \non a bonus even if you don\u2019t use it (you \nmust take the action, but the bonus is \noptional). Take the bonus and the action \nin any order.\nGrande Worker:  The grande worker \nacts as a regular worker, but it can be \nplaced on an action even if all action \nspaces are full (this ability can only be \nused on the board). The only way for a \ngrande worker to gain a bonus is to place \nit on a bonus action space.\nHarvest:  Choose a field on your \nvineyard mat that you have not already \nharvested this year (each field may only \nbe harvested once per year). Add up the \ntotal value of all red vines on that field \nand place a grape token on the space \nwith the corresponding value on your red \ncrush pad. Then do the same for white \nvines. The vine cards remain planted on \nthe fields (you\u2019re simply plucking grapes \nfrom those vines).Make Wine:  Using the grapes on \nyour crush pad, make 2 wine tokens \n(the type of wine may be different for \neach token). You cannot combine 2 \nsame-color grapes to make a wine of \nthe same color\u20141 red grape token \nbecomes 1 red wine token of the same \nvalue (devalue it if you don\u2019t have the \ncellar space). To make 1 blush wine \ntoken, combine 1 red grape token and \n1 white grape token\u2014add the values \nof the 2 grape tokens to determine the \nvalue of the blush wine token (must be \nat least 4). To make 1 sparkling wine \ntoken, combine 2 red grape tokens and \n1 white grape token\u2014add the values \nof the value of the 3 grape tokens to \ndetermine the value of the sparkling \nwine token (must be at least 7).\nPlace Grape Tokens on Crush Pad \nor Wine Tokens in Cellar: Some \nvisitor cards, trade actions, or special \nworkers enable you to \u201cplace\u201d a specific \ntype of token onto your vineyard \nmat. This is distinctly different than \nharvesting vines (to gain grape tokens) \nor making wine tokens (moving grape \ntokens to your cellar to become wine \ntokens).
